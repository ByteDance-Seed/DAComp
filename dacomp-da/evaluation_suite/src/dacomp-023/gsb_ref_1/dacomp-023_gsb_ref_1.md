## Recommendations

Based on this analysis, we propose the following recommendations:

1.  **Investigate High-Growth Categories:** Conduct a detailed analysis of the Furniture and Office Supplies categories to understand the drivers behind their rapid growth. This could involve examining specific products, marketing campaigns, or customer segments that are contributing to this success. The findings should be used to inform strategies for all categories.
2.  **Share Best Practices from Top Performers:** Facilitate knowledge sharing from the top-performing regional managers, especially He Liu, to other regions. This could involve mentorship programs, best practice workshops, or the development of a sales playbook based on successful strategies.
3.  **Support Underperforming Regions:** Develop a targeted support plan for the North China region. This could involve a review of the regional market, additional marketing resources, or sales training for the team. It would be beneficial to understand the specific challenges faced by Wang Qing and his team.

By focusing on these areas, we can capitalize on our strengths, address our weaknesses, and drive continued sales growth in the coming years.
