Using behavioral data from klaviyo__campaigns and klaviyo__persons, design an analysis on the combined effects of email send timing and subject. Evaluate how different send time windows (weekday/weekend, morning/afternoon, before/after holidays) and subject copy (SUBJECT keyword grouping such as discount, new, storytelling) interact to influence open rate, click rate, and subsequent active retention (active_retention_rate_week/month). Break down results by is_archived (archived vs non-archived) and variation_id (single send vs variant send), control for audience size (total_count_unique_people), and apply de-noising (for example, exclude anomalous spikes in count_received_email). Conclude with actionable recommendations and potential risks for different brand communication strategies.
