A sales team reorganization is imminent, requiring the design of a data-driven customer reallocation plan. First, calculate a workload score for each sales representative using the following fixed formula: Workload Score = Number of Customers*0.3 + Total Annual Revenue (in millions)/10*0.4 + Contact Coverage Rate (Number of Contacts / Number of Customers)*0.2 + Geographic Complexity Factor*0.1, where the Geographic Complexity Factor = DISTINCT(Number of States)*2 + DISTINCT(Number of Cities)*0.5, and the Contact Coverage Rate is capped at 5; then calculate a sales efficiency metric: Efficiency Score = Win Rate*0.4 + (Average Deal Size / 100,000)*0.3 + (120 / Average Sales Cycle Days)*0.2 + Opportunity Conversion Rate*0.1; based on the workload score, identify representatives with an uneven workload distribution (standard deviation > 0.3 * average), use a data science method you deem appropriate to design a customer reallocation algorithm. This algorithm must incorporate constraints such as geographic proximity (prioritize allocating customers within the same state), industry expertise match (at least 60% of a rep's customers should be in their top 3 industries), and customer size suitability. Propose a concrete customer transfer plan and quantify its expected impact. The final objective is to maximize the expected improvement in the overall team's efficiency score and customer retention probability, while ensuring the workload score for each rep is controlled within a ±15% variance range.
