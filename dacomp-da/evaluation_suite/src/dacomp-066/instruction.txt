The application screening to first interview conversion rate for the company's Engineering department has dropped from 35% to 22% over the past 6 months, significantly lower than the Marketing department's 45% conversion rate. Please use the `greenhouse__recruitment_performance` table to analyze which specific roles within the Engineering department (e.g., Frontend, Backend, Data Engineer) have experienced the most severe decline in conversion rate. Then, using the `greenhouse__job_enhanced` table's data on hiring managers and interviewers, identify if there are specific hiring managers whose assigned jobs have systematically lower conversion rates. Finally, quantify the impact of factors such as the number of interviewers and the hiring manager's years of experience on the conversion rate.
