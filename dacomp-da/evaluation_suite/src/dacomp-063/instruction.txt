The Project Management Committee has observed a perplexing phenomenon: certain projects exhibit an excellent `overall_health_score` and team performance (health score > 75, team performance score > 80), yet on the stakeholder engagement level, they show an `engagement_risk_status` of "High Risk". Simultaneously, issue intelligence analytics for these projects indicate high `high_complexity_risk` and `intervention_urgency`. What is more concerning is that upon deeper analysis, these "superficially healthy" projects show an anomalous `lifecycle_deviation_ratio`, a high assignee `assignment_risk_score`, and a mismatch between their cross-functional collaboration model (`cross_functional_projects`) and actual delivery outcomes. Please construct a comprehensive analytical framework to:

1) Identify and quantify the distribution characteristics of projects exhibiting this multi-dimensional contradictory phenomenon;
2) Based on multiple dimensions such as the team performance dashboard, stakeholder engagement patterns, and issue lifecycle analytics, design your own comprehensive risk assessment model to re-evaluate the true health status of these projects;
3) Conduct a deep-dive analysis into the root causes of this "false prosperity," paying special attention to hidden factors such as staffing efficiency, the quality of the communication and collaboration network, and workflow deviations.
