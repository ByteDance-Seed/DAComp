Given the rapid business growth, we need to forecast future hiring demand and resource allocation. Based on historical data from the `lever__posting_enhanced` and `lever__requisition_enhanced` tables, analyze the trend in the number of postings and the month-over-month (MoM) growth rate for each team over the past 6 months. Identify high-growth teams with a month-over-month demand growth rate exceeding 15% AND more than 10 current active postings. Calculate their 'Hiring Pressure Index,' defined as: (Number of pending roles / Number of existing hiring managers). Predict which teams are likely to face a resource shortage in the next 2 months, where their pressure index might exceed 8, and calculate how many additional recruiting resources are needed (based on a capacity of one hiring manager handling a maximum of 6 postings simultaneously).
