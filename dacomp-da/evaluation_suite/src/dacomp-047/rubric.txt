#### Path 2.1.C [4 points]: Scenario-based combination design (consumption scenarios + pricing strategy)
- Sub-standard 2.1.C.1 [1 point | Completeness]: Design differentiated combinations based on consumption scenarios (e.g., salad, quick stir-fry, light meals, home-style dishes), each combination clearly positioned (basic assurance/high-margin/value-for-money, etc.).
- Sub-standard 2.1.C.2 [2 points | Accuracy]: Verify by pseudo-process:
```
Scenario definition: Define 3 different consumption scenarios (e.g., summer salad/Chinese quick stir-fry/seasonal specialties)
Pricing strategy: Each combination explicitly sets price positioning (high margin/mid-range/affordable) and target customer segment
Combination logic: Design combination members based on cooking methods/nutritional pairing/flavor complementarity
Differentiation verification: Ensure the 3 combinations achieve differentiated coverage across scenarios/pricing/categories
```
- Sub-standard 2.1.C.3 [1 point | Conclusiveness]: Output scenario-based combination plans: include combination name, target scenario, price positioning, core selling points, and expected performance. Missing any one of these yields no points.

#### Path 2.1.F [3 points]: Loss control optimization
- Sub-standard 2.1.F.1 [1 point | Completeness]: Based on Loss Rate (%) data analysis, prioritize low-loss varieties to construct combinations, and provide loss-rate control strategies.

Failure to meet any element yields no points.
- Sub-standard 2.1.G.2 [2 points | Accuracy]: Item-level data within each combination (e.g., specified-period sales, Loss Rate (%)) must be fully consistent with the data outputs from earlier analysis (example: Broccoli July 2022 sales 1163.3 kg, Loss Rate (%) 9.26%).
- Sub-standard 2.1.G.3 [2 points | Conclusiveness]: For each combination, clearly explain the "core characteristics" (e.g., "summer refreshing type" "low-loss high-efficiency type") and "expected advantages" (e.g., "matches consumption trends" "reduces waste, increases profitability"), and the strategy differences between combinations must be obvious (e.g., respectively focusing on sales, seasonality, loss).
