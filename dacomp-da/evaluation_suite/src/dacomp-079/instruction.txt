We have observed that the proportion of users with more than 60 active days but who have clicked on fewer than 5 distinct features has reached 15%. The average NPS rating for these users is 0.8 points lower than that of normal users. Please conduct an in-depth analysis of the behavioral characteristics of this "single-feature-use" user segment, including which features they primarily focus on, whether their `average_daily_minutes` is anomalous, and the impact of this usage pattern on long-term retention.
