Noticing that some teams have high project health scores but low actual completion rates, you need to analyze teams from the `asana__team_efficiency_metrics` table where both `collaboration_efficiency_score` and `resource_optimization_score` are 8 or higher, but their `avg_completion_rate` is below 70%. Conduct an in-depth analysis of these teams' characteristics in terms of project size distribution, member workload, and task complexity to identify the underlying reasons for the mismatch between health scores and actual execution performance. Propose targeted team management optimization recommendations based on your findings.
