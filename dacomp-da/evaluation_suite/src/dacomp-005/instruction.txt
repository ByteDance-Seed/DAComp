Orders whose `Profit Margin` in `sheet1` is lower than 50% of the dataset average are defined as low-margin orders. Analyze the salient characteristics that distinguish these orders from the broader population (e.g., by `Sales Quantity`, `Total Logistics Revenue`, discount behavior, cost components such as `Freight Cost`, `Warehousing Cost`, `Other Operating Costs`, geographic distribution in `Destination`, time trends in `Date`, customer segments based on `Customer Age`, `Age Range`, `Customer Gender`, and product composition by `Consigned Product`), and then propose concrete, data-backed remedies that cover both cost-control (beating down expense) and revenue/profit uplift (improving efficiency and effectiveness). Keep every description precise, reference the English column names from the authoritative schema, and ensure thresholds or quantifiable insights stay aligned with the provided dataset.
