### Criterion 1.1 (3 points): Definition of analysis targets and scope (AND)
#### Path 1.1.A [3 points | Parameterized filtering and traceability]
- Sub-criterion 1.1.A.1 [1 point | Completeness]: Provide a configurable parameter set for defining “high traffic” (examples: Daily Visitor Count threshold, peak-hour visitor threshold, crowding index/visitor density per unit area, valid sampling period and time granularity), and record the actual parameter values and sources used for this analysis (no fixed specific numbers).
- Sub-criterion 1.1.A.2 [1 point | Precision]: Output the target set’s scale and coverage (Exhibition Hall count, Display case/monitoring point count, reading periods/sample size) together with the filtering log (time range, data sources, filtering rules, version/timestamp) to ensure reproducibility; the process must show unit harmonization, time zone/holiday treatment, and steps for masking anomalous readings.
- Sub-criterion 1.1.A.3 [1 point | Conclusiveness]: Provide a transparent fallback/degradation strategy: when visitor data are missing or conflicting, state substitute criteria (e.g., rolling average over the most recent cycle, adjacent Exhibition Hall quantile bands, museum-level baseline) and explicitly mark “inferred” results and uncertainty ranges; produce an executable list of targets (with criteria tags).
### Criterion 1.2 (3 points): Configurable thresholds and sensitivity framework (AND)
#### Path 1.2.A [3 points | Pluggable standards and versioning]
- Sub-criterion 1.2.A.1 [1 point | Completeness]: Provide an “indicator—risk threshold—level” parameter table (covering at least Temperature, Relative Humidity, Carbon dioxide, particulate matter, VOCs, Illuminance, UV, microbial/surface hygiene among ≥6 items) and a “material sensitivity dictionary” (Light/Temperature/Humidity/Contamination sensitivities and evaluation criteria); field names and sources must be clear, with no fixed specific numbers.
- Sub-criterion 1.2.A.2 [1 point | Precision]: Specify threshold sources and priority (industry standards/the museum’s SOP/expert opinion/historical quantiles), provide unit harmonization and conversion rules, and conflict resolution methods; the parameter table must have a version number/effective date/applicable scope, with traceable change logs.
- Sub-criterion 1.2.A.3 [1 point | Conclusiveness]: Complete a threshold sensitivity pre-check: under two parameter schemes (e.g., “conservative/relaxed”), compare overall exceedance rates or Top-N ranking robustness (overlap/salient differences), and provide change explanations (process and conclusion types only; no fixed numbers required).

- Sub-criterion 2.2.A.2 [1 point | Precision]: Explain strategies for missing/abnormal values (deletion/truncation/imputation/bucketing) and uncertainty propagation (e.g., interval scoring/Monte Carlo), and assess their impact on rankings (e.g., quantile bands or interval rankings), forming an impact record.
- Sub-criterion 2.2.A.3 [1 point | Precision]: Perform at least one weight perturbation/threshold scheme switch (e.g., “conservative vs relaxed”), compare Top-N set similarity (Jaccard/overlap rate), and interpret dominant indicators and reasons for changes.

#### Path 2.3.A [2 points | Correlation and binning + interpretation]
- Sub-criterion 2.3.A.1 [1 point | Precision]: Compute at least two statistical relationships between “traffic (or crowding)” and environmental/exposure indicators (Pearson/Spearman/nonparametric correlations are acceptable), report r and p (or confidence intervals), and provide a table of binned means/medians by traffic quantiles; specify time alignment and lag handling (e.g., same-window aggregation/lag k).
- Sub-criterion 2.3.A.2 [1 point | Conclusiveness]: Based on evidence, judge the relationship type (positive/negative/not significant/possibly monotonic nonlinear), and provide business interpretation and operational insights (e.g., peak-time capacity limiting, increased fresh air, light/UV controls, microclimate buffering), avoiding hard numbers irrelevant to the museum and maintaining transferability.
