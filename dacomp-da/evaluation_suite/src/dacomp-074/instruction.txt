The CFO wants to build a more accurate cash flow forecasting model. Analyze the historical cash flow trajectories of subsidiaries marked with a 'High' `cash_flow_risk_level`, focusing on the changes in their key financial indicators during the 6 months prior to them entering this risk state. The specific dimensions of analysis include: revenue recognition (frequency of monthly revenue fluctuations exceeding 20%), accounts receivable management (the proportion of time `weighted_average_days_outstanding` exceeds 45 days, and instances where `overdue_percentage` rises for 3 consecutive months), and expense control (the degree of divergence between the growth rate of 'expense' account type expenditures and the revenue growth rate). By comparing the indicator trajectories of these high-risk subsidiaries with those of financially healthy subsidiaries over the same time dimensions, identify a combination of key indicators and threshold settings that can provide a 2-3 month early warning for cash flow crises.
