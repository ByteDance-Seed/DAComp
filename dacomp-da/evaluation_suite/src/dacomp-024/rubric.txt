#### Path 1.1.A [4 points]: Sales penetration analysis 
- Sub-criterion 1.1.A.1 [1 point | completeness]: Define precisely: sales penetration rate % = Region’s sales in the Segment / Nationwide sales in the Segment; compute annually for 2015/2016/2017 or provide the three-year average to earn credit.
- Sub-criterion 1.1.A.2 [3 points | accuracy]: Annual and three-year average methodologies are correct; hit the following anchors (tolerance ±1%):
  - Three-year methodology (2015–2017 average, based on actual data): West–Consumer ≈29.72%; East–Home Office ≈35.00%; West–Corporate ≈31.23%. Note: if only the three-year average is reported, award 2 points.
