The analysis of priority customers (Contact priority = 1) revealed the following insights:

1. **Satisfaction Scores Missing**: No satisfaction score data was found in either the `complaints_table` or the `service_ticket_table` for priority customers. This indicates either a lack of feedback or a data recording issue.

2. **Resolution Time Data Unavailable**: There were no valid timestamps for complaint or service ticket resolutions, suggesting missing or improperly recorded data. This prevents calculating average resolution times.

### Recommendations
- **Data Quality Audit**: Conduct a review of the data entry processes to ensure that all customer interactions, including satisfaction scores and resolution times, are consistently recorded.
- **Feedback Collection**: Implement a more robust feedback mechanism to capture customer satisfaction scores for priority customers.
- **Process Monitoring**: Enhance monitoring of service ticket and complaint resolution times to ensure accurate data collection and timely service delivery.

This analysis highlights the need for improved data completeness to better assess and enhance service performance for priority customers.
