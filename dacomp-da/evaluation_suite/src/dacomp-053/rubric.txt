---
## Requirement 1: Calculate three core metrics by health grade (A/B/C/D/F) (Max 8 points for this requirement)
### Standard 1.1 (Max 2 points, weighting factor 2/6)
#### Path 1.1.A (Completeness) (2 points | Predicted Total Duration Approach)
##### Sub-standard 1.1.A.1 (1 point | Completeness) Filter by `is_valid_record=1`, `planned_duration_days>0`, and state the approach for predicted duration:  
`predicted_total_days = CASE WHEN completion_percentage>=99 THEN elapsed_days ELSE elapsed_days + COALESCE(estimated_days_to_completion, remaining_days, 0) END`.
##### Sub-standard 1.1.A.2 (1 point | Precision) Reproduce the statistical logic in pseudocode, including the >20% overdue check:
```
INPUT: Filtered sample from asana__project_analytics
STEP1: Calculate predicted_total_days
STEP2: overrun_flag_pred = 1{predicted_total_days > 1.2*planned_duration_days}
STEP3: Aggregate by health_grade → AVG(roi_efficiency_ratio), AVG(completion_percentage), AVG(overrun_flag_pred)
```
##### Sub-standard 1.1.A.3 (0 points | Conclusion) Explain that the prediction approach covers ongoing projects, avoiding the underestimation of duration that would occur by only using `elapsed_days`.

#### Path 1.1.B (Completeness) (2 points | Simplified Actual Duration Approach)
##### Sub-standard 1.1.B.1 (1 point | Completeness) State the same filters `is_valid_record=1`, `planned_duration_days>0`, and directly compare `elapsed_days` with the planned duration.
##### Sub-standard 1.1.B.2 (1 point | Precision) Provide the determination pseudocode: `overrun_flag_elapsed = 1{elapsed_days > 1.2*planned_duration_days}`, and ensure metric calculation is consistent with 1.2.A.
##### Sub-standard 1.1.B.3 (0 points | Conclusion) Note that this approach is suitable for completed projects but will underestimate potential overruns for in-progress projects.

#### Path 1.2.A (Precision) (6 points | Output three metrics by health grade)
##### Sub-standard 1.2.A.1 (1 point | Completeness) Output the average ROI, average completion rate, and the proportion of `overrun_flag_elapsed` >20% by `health_grade`.
##### Sub-standard 1.2.A.2 (4 points | Precision) Results must fall within the following anchor points ± tolerance (ROI tolerance ±0.005, completion rate tolerance ±0.5pp, overdue proportion tolerance ±0.02):
- A: ROI 0.927678, Completion Rate 96.002%, Overdue Proportion 0.333

##### Sub-standard 2.1.B.2 (1 point | Precision) State that using Q1/Q3 thresholds results in 0 inverted projects in both high-health and low-health sub-samples, and based on this, propose an alternative threshold (e.g., use Q1_grade for high-health and Q3_grade for low-health) or adjust to ROI≤0.52 and ≥0.21 to get the smallest non-zero samples (1 and 9 projects, respectively).
##### Sub-standard 2.1.B.3 (1 point | Conclusion) Note that global thresholds ignore inter-grade distribution differences and lead to sparse samples, requiring a return to an intra-grade baseline.

HHLV = High complexity(1.79) + many handoffs(6.7 assignees) + weak time management(72.5) + slow progress(CRPD 1.09) + 64% overdue → ROI 0.58 (far below 0.95 baseline);  
LHHV = CRPD 0.235, efficiency 70.8, time management 54.0 → ROI 0.138 (higher than peer group's 0.061), but judged low-health due to 74.8% risk and low completion rate; point out that the health score is biased towards process metrics and neglects the time value of money.
##### Sub-standard 4.1.A.3 (1 point | Conclusion) Emphasize that "Health ≠ Value" and the evaluation system needs to be redesigned to avoid resource misallocation.

##### Sub-standard 5.1.A.3 (0.5 points | Conclusion) Explain that VHS can reduce the HHLV proportion from 16.4% to <10% (by timely identifying high-complexity lagging projects) and highlight high-value opportunities to improve the precision of resource allocation.

#### Path 5.1.B (Precision) (1 point | Strengthening Governance Process)
##### Sub-standard 5.1.B.1 (0.5 points | Completeness) Develop an action matrix:  
HHLV: `overall_health_score≥80 ∧ overrun_flag_elapsed=1 ∧ ROI<Q1_grade` → Trigger scope freeze + dedicated re-planning (target to reduce overrun to <30% within 2 weeks);  
LHHV: `overall_health_score<60 ∧ completion_rate_per_day≥P75` → Trigger resource focus & risk reassessment, set a target to increase completion rate by ≥10pp within 4 weeks.
##### Sub-standard 5.1.B.2 (0.5 points | Precision) Explain the process closed-loop: Alert → Verification (review of time management/complexity) → Action (resource scheduling/rapid risk response) → VHS re-evaluation, supporting a closed-loop evaluation system.
