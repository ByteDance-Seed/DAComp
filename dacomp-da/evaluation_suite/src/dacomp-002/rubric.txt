# [Total Score | 22 points] The solution must satisfy three requirements:

## Requirement 1: Analysis of the Sales Amount growth trend for each Major Category from January to April (This requirement can earn up to 10 points)
### Criterion 1.1 [Up to 4 points]: Calculate the Sales Amount for each Major Category
#### Path 1.1.A [4 points]: Comprehensive data processing and analysis 
-  Sub-criterion 1.1.A.1 [1 point | Completeness]: Group all data by Sales Month and Major Category Name, then compute the total Sales Amount for each Major Category.
-  Sub-criterion 1.1.A.2 [1 point | Completeness]: Compute the total Sales Amount for every Major Category. If only some major categories are selected and calculated after sampling, this item receives no points.
- Sub-criterion 1.1.A.3 [2 points | Accuracy]: Sales Amount calculations are correct; verification reference values are shown in the table below. All data must match the table for full accuracy credit. Note: applying round half up, alternative rounding rules used in Chinese practice (e.g., “five down six up,” “four down six up”), integer rounding, or retaining different numbers of decimal places is also considered correct. No points deducted if April Bakery data is missing.

 Method 2: You may use a different classification approach to define and group all Major Categories, then summarize the changing trends for different groups. Below is one reference classification. You may adopt other classification methods.
* Sales Amount continuously increasing: None
* Sales Amount continuously decreasing: Cultural & Sports Goods, Bakery, Grain and Oil
* Sales Amount fluctuating: Leisure Foods, Drink Mixes, Home Goods, Home Appliances, Daily Fresh Products, Aquatic Products, Cleaning & Personal Care, Prepared Foods, Meat and Poultry, Vegetables and Fruits, Alcohol & Beverages, Knitted Goods

- Sub-criterion 1.2.A.4 [1 point ｜ Conclusiveness]: The summary covers the changing trends of all 15 categories. Each category is summarized separately; if not all 15 categories are covered, points will be deducted.

- Sub-criterion 2.1.A.2 [2 points | Accuracy]: The Sales Amount share is calculated correctly; verification baseline values are as follows. Note: applying round half up, alternative rounding rules used in Chinese practice (e.g., “five down six up,” “four down six up”), integer rounding, or retaining different numbers of decimal places is also considered correct. No points deducted if April Bakery data is missing.
| Major Category Name | January share | February share | March share | April share |
| -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| Leisure Foods | 15.85% | 18.03% | 15.57% | 15.24% |

### Criterion 2.2 [Up to 4 points]: Analyze changes in customer purchasing preferences
#### Path 2.2.A [4 points]: Detailed preference analysis 
- Sub-criterion 2.2.A.1 [1 point | Completeness]: Based on the Sales Amount share data, analyze changes in customer purchasing preferences, and provide **detailed elaboration** and a summary of preference shifts across different stages, such as shifts from “stock-up” to “immediate freshness,” product type preferences, and price sensitivity.
- Sub-criterion 2.2.A.2 [1 point | Completeness]: Analyze changes in customer purchasing preferences from multiple perspectives.
- Sub-criterion 2.2.A.3 [1 point | Conclusiveness]: The preference analysis is reasonable, with detailed explanations of the reasons for changes tied to actual data; reasons must be strongly associated with the observed changes, with no logical gaps and no hallucinated data. Reference dimensions:
* Perspective 1: Analyze metrics changes for a single category from January–April. For example, based on Sales Volume share across months, customer preferences are clearly influenced by seasons and holidays. Alcohol & Beverages show a significant increase in February during the Spring Festival period.
* Perspective 2: Cross-compare consumption shares across different categories. For example, in the overall share, Leisure Foods, Daily Fresh Products, and Vegetables and Fruits are daily consumer goods whose overall shares consistently remain at higher levels; Home Goods and Home Appliances have lower consumption frequency, so their overall shares are consistently low.
- Sub-criterion 2.2.A.4 [1 point | Conclusiveness]: If the analysis conclusions include multiple perspectives and provide conclusions, this item can earn points.

Recommendations must be reasonable and feasible, and strongly related to summer consumption demand and the trends identified in the prior analysis.
### Criterion 3.2 [Up to 2 points]: Formulate an inventory management strategy
#### Path 3.2.A [2 points]: Comprehensive inventory strategy 
- Sub-criterion 3.2.A.1 [1 point | Completeness]: Formulate a comprehensive inventory management strategy that covers multiple different management states.
