In a recent analysis of ad performance, an anomaly was discovered where some ad groups exhibit a high click-through rate (CTR) but a low conversion rate. This suggests a potential mismatch between user search intent and ad content. Using the criteria of a CTR greater than the 75th percentile and a conversion rate less than the 25th percentile to identify problem ad groups, please conduct an in-depth analysis of the characteristic patterns of these high-CTR, low-conversion ad groups. Your analysis should incorporate multiple dimensions, including basic ad group data, keyword match types, audience targeting attributes, device distribution, time-of-day performance, geographical distribution, landing page quality scores, and bidding strategy. You are required to calculate an Intent Match Index (actual conversion rate / expected conversion rate for the same industry and keyword) and a Traffic Quality Score. Based on your findings, identify the root causes and propose a systematic solution that includes keyword optimization, audience segmentation, landing page improvements, bid adjustments, and time-of-day optimizations.
