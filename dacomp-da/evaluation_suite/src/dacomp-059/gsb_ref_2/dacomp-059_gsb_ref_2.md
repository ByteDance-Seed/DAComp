## Executive Summary

Our analysis of 10,000 Google Ads ad groups revealed a critical performance anomaly: **616 ad groups (6.2%) exhibit high click-through rates but disappointingly low conversion rates**. These problematic ad groups waste $57,228 in ad spend while delivering 63% below-expected conversion performance.

## Key Findings

### 📊 Performance Metrics
- **CTR Threshold**: 3.82% (75th percentile)
- **Conversion Rate Threshold**: 3.33% (25th percentile)
- **Problematic Ad Groups**: 616 out of 10,000 total

### 🔍 Root Cause Analysis

![Executive Summary](executive_summary.png)

#### 1. Keyword Match Type Issues
**48% of problematic keywords use broad match types**, compared to the more targeted distribution in well-performing campaigns:

- **Broad Match**: 25.7% (attracts untargeted traffic)
- **Broad Match Modifier**: 22.3% (moderate targeting)
- **Phrase Match**: 28.7% (better intent matching)
- **Exact Match**: 23.3% (highest intent precision)

#### 2. Intent Mismatch Syndrome
The **Intent Match Index of 0.37** reveals that these ad groups attract clicks from users who are 63% less likely to convert than expected. This indicates a fundamental disconnect between user search intent and ad content relevance.

#### 3. Cost Efficiency Problems
- **Cost Per Click**: $2.72 (similar to overall average)
- **Cost Per Conversion**: $146.69 (significantly higher than optimal)
- **Conversion Rate**: 2.00% (64% below overall average of 5.53%)
