- Sub-standard 1.2.A.3 [1 point | Conclusiveness] Identifies the extremely high-risk band with scores ≥70 (22 customers, approx. 5.5% of the high-risk group) and explains the need for priority intervention based on their payment rate, credit score, or balance characteristics.

#### Path 1.2.B [4 points | Score variation and comparison]
- Sub-standard 1.2.B.1 [1 point | Completeness] Explains the use of an equivalent normalization scheme (e.g., Z-score or quantile scaling for the three metrics before weighting) and clarifies its consistency with the original logic.
- Sub-standard 1.2.B.2 [2 points | Accuracy] Demonstrates a ranking or Spearman correlation ≥0.95 (or equivalent evidence) to prove the variant score does not alter the risk ranking, and explains the marginal impact of weight differences on the result.
- Sub-standard 1.2.B.3 [1 point | Conclusiveness] Compares the segmentation results of the original score and the variant (e.g., number of customers with scores ≥60, difference in average balance) and recommends the most suitable scheme for business monitoring.

- Sub-standard 4.2.A.3 [1 point | Conclusiveness] States that high-risk customers are concentrated in the "medium-to-high ticket size, 10-99 invoice count" range, and a small number of high-value orders amplify the risk.

#### Path 4.2.B [3 points | Concentration analysis]
- Sub-standard 4.2.B.1 [1 point | Completeness] Calculates the proportion of the top 10% of high-risk customers' outstanding balance relative to the total high-risk outstanding balance.
- Sub-standard 4.2.B.2 [1 point | Accuracy] Anchor point: The top 10% outstanding balance is 7,660,804.86, which is 17.87% of the total high-risk outstanding balance.

### Standard 5.1: Potential loss estimation (Max 5 points)
#### Path 5.1.A [5 points | Scenario method using revenue × collection rate]
- Sub-standard 5.1.A.1 [1 point | Completeness] Uses the last 12-month average revenue of 5,641,018.82 as a baseline and sets at least two collection rate scenarios: the latest value of 45.76% and a stress scenario (latest value - longest consecutive deterioration of 5.78pp = 39.98%).
- Sub-standard 5.1.A.2 [3 points | Accuracy] Calculates the 6-month potential loss (error ≤3%): baseline loss=1,043,306.43; stress loss=2,999,611.76; allocated based on the high-risk receivables proportion of 64.71%: 675,137.36 and 1,941,088.36 respectively.
- Sub-standard 5.1.A.3 [1 point | Conclusiveness] States the loss range under the two scenarios and explains the logic of how the cash gap widens if the collection rate continues to deteriorate.

#### Path 5.1.B [5 points | Net cash flow conversion]
- Sub-standard 5.1.B.1 [1 point | Completeness] Uses the sum of `forecasted_net_cash_flow` for the next 6 months from `quickbooks__cashflow_forecast` (442,502) as a baseline. When `inflows` are missing, uses the 12-month cumulative decline of 13.46pp as a reduction factor.

- Sub-standard 5.1.B.3 [1 point | Conclusiveness] Emphasizes that this method is conservative and recommends populating the forecast fields to improve accuracy.

#### Path 5.1.C [5 points | Receivables balance conversion]
- Sub-standard 5.1.C.1 [1 point | Completeness] Estimates extreme loss as high-risk outstanding balance of 42.86M multiplied by the collection rate decline (5.78pp or 4.91pp).
- Sub-standard 5.1.C.2 [3 points | Accuracy] Outputs a range: ≈2,477,195 (for 5.78pp decline) and ≈2,104,330 (for 4.91pp decline), and explains its role as an upper-bound risk estimate.
- Sub-standard 5.1.C.3 [1 point | Conclusiveness] Suggests preparing a cash buffer or external financing options in case the collection rate continues to deteriorate.

### Standard 5.2: Risk concentration and tiering (Max 2 points)
#### Path 5.2.A [2 points | Quantitative risk tiering]
- Sub-standard 5.2.A.1 [1 point | Completeness] Segments customers based on risk score (≥60, 40-59.9, <40) and lists the customer count and balance for each tier: ≥60=116 customers/12.60M, 40-59.9=259 customers/27.80M, <40=24 customers/2.46M.
- Sub-standard 5.2.A.2 [1 point | Conclusiveness] Notes that the 40-59.9 tier accounts for ~65% of the balance, but the ≥60 tier still holds a significant 12.6M and should be prioritized for attention.

### Standard 5.3: Continuous monitoring metrics (Max 1 point)
#### Path 5.3.A [1 point | Conclusiveness] Proposes monitoring KPIs for the next 6 months (e.g., a consecutive decline of ≥3 months triggers an alert, a threshold for the balance of Top 10% customers, a monthly collection rate target of ≥48%), which correspond to the scenario calculations.

- Sub-standard 6.1.A.2 [1 point | Accuracy] Ensures strategies are supported by data evidence (e.g., ≥70 tier: 22 customers with 2.27M balance; Top 10% customers account for 17.87% of high-risk balance; loss proportion of 13.81%).
- Sub-standard 6.1.A.3 [1 point | Conclusiveness] Proposes quantitative goals and a review frequency (e.g., reduce the high-risk receivables proportion from 64.71% to <50% within 60 days, increase the monthly collection rate by ≥2pp).

#### Path 6.1.B [3 points | Integrated credit, pricing, and collections strategy]
- Sub-standard 6.1.B.1 [1 point | Completeness] Covers credit limit adjustments, collection cadence, pricing/gross profit remediation, and cash buffering strategies (e.g., factoring/credit insurance).
