We have observed that the payment behavior of some customers is deteriorating. Please filter the customer group from the `quickbooks__customer_analytics` table with a `payment_rate_percentage` below 75% and an `outstanding_balance` exceeding 15,000. Calculate a composite risk score for these high-risk customers (Formula: Risk Score = (100 - `payment_rate_percentage`) * 0.4 + (850 - `credit_score`) / 850 * 100 * 0.4 + (100 - `business_stability_score`) * 0.2). In conjunction with the `quickbooks__profitability_analysis` table, calculate the proportion of these customers' `gross_profit` to the total profit of all customers. Simultaneously, analyze the month-over-month trend of the `collection_rate_percentage` from the `quickbooks__financial_dashboard` table for the last 12 months, identifying the number of consecutive months of deterioration and the magnitude of the decline. Further analyze the distribution characteristics of these problem customers across dimensions such as `customer_lifespan_days`, `total_invoices`, `avg_invoice_amount`, and `profitability_tier`, exploring their differential patterns compared to normal customers. Finally, using the forecast data from the `quickbooks__cashflow_forecast` table, build a risk warning model to assess the potential loss scale for the next 6 months, and from a business perspective, propose tiered customer management and risk control strategies.
