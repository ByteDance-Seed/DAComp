Compare and analyze how the primary barrier factors to treatment adherence differ across patient age groups (recommended groupings: young adults 18–44, middle-aged 45–59, older adults 60+), and how the impact of these barriers on the degree of symptom improvement differs across age groups. Based on the distinct challenges of each age group, propose targeted intervention strategies for each group, and set quantifiable monitoring indicators for each strategy to evaluate its applicability and effectiveness across different populations.
