## Recommendations

### Recommended Optimal Management Ratios by Size
| Organization Size | Recommended Management Ratio | Staffing Density (Employees per Manager) |
|-------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Small             | 0.19                         | 5.26                                     |
| Medium            | 0.14                         | 7.14                                     |
| Large             | 0.23                         | 4.35                                     |
| Extra Large       | 0.23                         | 4.35                                     |

These management ratios are derived from the top-performing organizations and aim to balance oversight with operational efficiency.

### Strategic Actions
1. **Small Organizations (0–30 Employees)**
   - Maintain a management ratio of ~19%
   - Ensure high position fill rate (>95%)
   - Focus on retaining high performers to reduce turnover

2. **Medium Organizations (30–120 Employees)**
   - Target a management ratio of ~14%
   - Streamline decision-making while maintaining performance
   - Encourage internal mobility to reduce turnover

3. **Large Organizations (120–300 Employees)**
   - Aim for a management ratio of ~23%
   - Focus on improving recruitment and onboarding to raise performance
   - Implement structured performance development plans

4. **Extra Large Organizations (Over 300 Employees)**
   - Maintain a management ratio of ~23%
   - Invest in leadership development programs
   - Monitor turnover closely and implement retention strategies

### Conclusion
Optimal management ratios significantly vary by organization size. Smaller organizations benefit from relatively flat structures (lower management ratio), while medium and larger organizations achieve better performance with slightly higher ratios to ensure adequate supervision and support. Implementing these data-driven benchmarks can help improve organizational health and performance outcomes across all tiers.
