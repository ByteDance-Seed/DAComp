The company is redesigning its organizational structure, and I want you to identify the optimal organizational size and management configuration model from a data perspective. Please segment all organizations into four tiers based on `current_active_employees`: Small (under 30), Medium (30-120), Large (120-300), and Extra Large (over 300). Then, for each tier, calculate the distribution characteristics of `organization_health_score` and the composition ratio of `performance_category`. Focus on analyzing the optimal range for `management_ratio` across different organization sizes by comparing key indicators such as `avg_employee_performance_score`, `position_fill_rate`, and `annual_turnover_rate`. Identify the common characteristics of the top 10% performing organizations in each size tier. Finally, based on these findings, provide quantitative management configuration recommendations for organizations of different sizes, including specific values for optimal management ratios, staffing density, and other metrics.
