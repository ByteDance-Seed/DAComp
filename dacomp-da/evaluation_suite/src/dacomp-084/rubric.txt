# [Total Score | 40 Points] Scoring Rubric for Organization Size and Management Configuration Optimization

The analysis must satisfy the following four core requirements, presented in a "Requirement → Standard → Path → Sub-standard" structure. Unless otherwise specified, all statistics are based on the full dataset (118 records) from the `workday__organization_overview` table in `/tasks/dacomp-084/dacomp-084.sqlite`, using the fixed size tiers: Small <30; Medium 30–120; Large 121–300; Extra Large >300. No additional data cleaning is allowed.

- Sub-standard 2.2.A.2 [5 Points | Accuracy] The composite score ranking must identify the following optimal ranges (tolerance ±0.01):
    - Small: 0.195–0.223 (health≈71.50, performance≈3.854, fill≈0.903, turnover≈0.176)
    - Medium: 0.151–0.170 (≈71.40, 3.906, 0.900, 0.174)
    - Large: 0.221–0.233 (≈73.975, 3.815, 0.895, 0.158)
    - Extra Large: One of two conclusions is acceptable:
        1. If using a simple average method, 0.274–0.299 is the top bin (health≈73.20, fill rate≈0.884, turnover≈0.149).
        2. If emphasizing high-performance cases, must state that 0.214–0.243 also falls within the Top 10% results and explain the difference between the average bin and Top 10% cases.
- Sub-standard 2.2.A.3 [1 Point | Conclusion] Summarize the "sweet spot" and "risk zones" for each tier and explain the business impact of excessively low/high management density (e.g., redundancy in medium orgs, lack of coordination in extra-large orgs).

- Sub-standard 2.2.B.1 [1 Point | Completeness] Use uniform intervals (<0.10, 0.10–0.15, 0.15–0.20, 0.20–0.25, ≥0.25) and report the mean of indicators and sample count for each interval (must be ≥3, otherwise state that it is not scored or is flagged as a risk).
- Sub-standard 2.2.B.2 [4 Points | Accuracy] The identified trends must match the database:
    - Small: 0.10–0.15 and 0.20–0.25 both perform well; 0.20–0.25 is a "high-density" option (health 67.913, fill 0.882, turnover 0.204, sample 15).
    - Medium: 0.10–0.15 is significantly better than 0.20–0.25 (the latter has only 1 sample with very poor performance: health 30.7, perf 2.14, fill 0.612, turnover 0.301).
    - Large: 0.15–0.20 is better than 0.20–0.25 (health 66.49 vs 64.609, turnover 0.199 vs 0.226).
    - Extra Large: 0.20–0.25 is better than ≥0.25 (health 69.356 vs 63.471, turnover 0.204 vs 0.219).

    - Performance correlation: Medium -0.317, Extra Large -0.295, other tiers close to 0
    - Fill rate correlation: Medium -0.145, Large -0.159, Extra Large -0.249
    - Turnover correlation: Medium 0.192, Large 0.096, Extra Large -0.087
- Sub-standard 2.2.C.3 [1 Point | Conclusion] Explain what the correlation results imply for the optimal ranges (e.g., Medium size is most sensitive to high management density, Large size needs to maintain a mid-to-high density to control turnover).

### Standard 2.3: Summarizing the Optimal Range (Max 3 Points | Deterministic)

#### Path 2.3.A [3 Points | Interval Synthesis]
- Sub-standard 2.3.A.1 [1 Point | Completeness] Synthesize results from binning, fixed-interval, and correlation analyses to provide a final recommended management ratio range for each of the four size tiers, along with reference mean values for health, performance, fill rate, and turnover within that range.
- Sub-standard 2.3.A.2 [1 Point | Accuracy] Ranges must be consistent with database evidence: Small 0.20–0.22 (can supplement with a lean model of 0.12–0.14 and its pros/cons), Medium 0.15–0.17 (emphasize risks of ≥0.18), Large 0.22–0.23 (sharp decline at ≥0.24), Extra Large 0.24–0.25 (if recommending 0.27–0.30, must state it's only for conservative retention scenarios).
- Sub-standard 2.3.A.3 [1 Point | Conclusion] Summarize the pattern that "the larger the size, the higher the optimal range" and point out the business consequences of being over or under the limit.
