We need to re-examine the effectiveness of our customer segmentation strategy. Please analyze whether the current `profitability_segment` classifications align with actual customer performance, with a special focus on customer groups where the `retention_probability` deviates by more than 0.15 (i.e., the difference from the segment's average retention rate is greater than 15 percentage points). The analysis should focus on the characteristics of these "classification anomaly" customers across the following dimensions: transactional behavior (consistency between `transaction_count` and `avg_transactions_per_month`, and the level of `transaction_value_volatility`), seasonal patterns (the balance of transaction distribution across Q1-Q4), and value realization path (the alignment between `comprehensive_customer_score` and `total_revenue`). Using cluster analysis and decision tree methods, explore whether new dimensions such as transaction stability, seasonal preference, or customer lifecycle stage should be introduced into the existing segmentation model to improve segmentation precision and predictive accuracy.
