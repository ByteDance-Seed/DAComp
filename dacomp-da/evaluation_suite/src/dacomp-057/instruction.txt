The marketing team has observed complex decay patterns in the customer acquisition efficiency of multiple long-running advertising campaigns. Based on a joined analysis of the `google_ads__customer_acquisition_analysis` and `google_ads__campaign_report` tables, identify campaigns that have been running for more than 120 days and, in the last 30 days, exhibit a Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) growth rate exceeding 25% while their LTV/CAC ratio has declined by more than 20%.

You are required to conduct an in-depth analysis of how different combinations of `campaign_lifecycle_stage` (Growth, Mature, Decline), `advertising_channel_type`, `customer_maturity_stage`, and `account_maturity_stage` impact this acquisition efficiency decay. Incorporate multi-dimensional metrics such as `acquisition_sophistication_score`, `cac_efficiency_percentile`, and `channel_diversity_count` to build a comprehensive decay risk assessment model that includes factors like channel saturation, competitive intensity, and customer quality stratification. 

Additionally, consider the distribution of `strategic_customer_segment`, `retention_risk` warning signals, and the `scale_opportunity` potential assessment to provide differentiated optimization recommendations for campaigns in various decay stages. Your focus should be on adjusting acquisition strategies for high-value customer segments and proposing budget reallocation plans.
