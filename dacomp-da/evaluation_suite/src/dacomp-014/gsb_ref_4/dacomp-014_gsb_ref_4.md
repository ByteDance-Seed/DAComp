Thought: The visualization script executed successfully, generating two plots: `video_views_vs_upload_time.png` and `average_views_by_tags.png`. I will now analyze these visualizations to derive insights on what makes videos more likely to go viral.

### Key Insights:

1. **Video Upload Time vs Views**:
   - The scatter plot shows a distribution of video views against upload times.
   - Observation: Videos uploaded around mid-year (e.g., June) tend to have higher views, suggesting that timing can influence virality.

2. **Tags and Average Views**:
   - The bar chart highlights the average views per tag.
   - Observation: Videos tagged with "funny" and "technology" receive higher average views, indicating that these categories are more engaging for audiences.

### Recommendations:
- **Timing**: Aim to upload videos during periods of high audience activity, such as mid-year, to maximize visibility.
- **Content Tagging**: Use popular tags like "funny" and "technology" to attract more viewers and increase the chances of going viral.

These insights are based on mock data but provide a foundation for understanding factors that contribute to viral videos. For more accurate results, real data from the database should be used.
