If the solution analyzes top-ranked or larger-sample videos, validate using this pseudo-code:
```
// Pseudo-code: verify a single case
For each Video Category:
1. Filter videos per the range specified in the solution.
2. For the filtered subset:
   a. Compute average views, occurrence count, and median views by category.
3. Present category name plus computed average views, occurrences, and median views. Each metric is worth 1 point.
