Management is concerned about our hiring funnel efficiency and wants to know which stages are the biggest bottlenecks. By analyzing the average time candidates spend in each hiring stage and the attrition rate, identify key bottleneck stages where the average time spent exceeds 25 days and the attrition rate is higher than 40%. Additionally, calculate an "efficiency index" for each stage (defined as: pass_rate / avg_days * 100), find stages with an efficiency index below 1.5, and provide improvement recommendations based on stage data with at least 100 samples.
