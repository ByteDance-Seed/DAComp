We've observed a clear stratification of engagement among our user base, especially noting from the `user_cohort_analysis` table that `power_users` constitute a small fraction of the total but contribute significant value. Can you build a user value scoring model? The requirements are to calculate a composite score from 0-100 based on dimensions such as users' historical participation frequency, completion rate, and cross-channel activity. You also need to identify the key behavioral characteristics that drive the transition from `medium_value` to `high_value` users. Concurrently, analyze the differences in value transition paths among users of different languages and geographical regions. Finally, deliver an analysis report that includes a user segmentation strategy and a personalized incentive plan.
