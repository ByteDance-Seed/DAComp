The company needs to analyze the reasons behind the decline in project delivery efficiency. Based on the existing data: first compute each user’s average task completion time (asana__user.avg_close_time_assigned_days), identify the user cohort whose completion time exceeds 1.5× the overall average, then analyze the distribution characteristics of the tasks handled by these users across complexity_score, urgency_score, and project_health_score. Meanwhile, compute each team’s task completion rate (completed_tasks/total_tasks) and average project health score, and identify underperforming teams. On this basis, dig deeper into the root causes of inefficiency, analyze the fit between individual capability and task assignment, explore opportunities to improve team collaboration models, and, combined with time trends, identify key influencing factors. Finally, produce concrete recommendations to improve efficiency.
