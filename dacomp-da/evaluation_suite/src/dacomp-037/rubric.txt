## Requirement 1: Analyze the differences in health checkup data between people with a medical history and those with no medical history (Maximum 8 points for this requirement)
### Criterion 1.1: Grouping and difference analysis (Maximum 8 points)
#### Path 1.1.A [8 points | Comprehensive statistical analysis]
- Sub-criterion 1.1.A.1 [1 point | Completeness]: Group into with medical history vs no medical history; individuals with Diabetes, Heart disease, or Hypertension are considered to have a medical history.
- Sub-criterion 1.1.A.2 [1 point | Completeness]: Compute the mean of health checkup data for people with a medical history and for those with no medical history
- Sub-criterion 1.1.A.3 [1 point | Completeness]: Compare the health checkup data across the two groups and identify indicators with differences
- Sub-criterion 1.1.A.4 [2 points | Accuracy]: Below are the health checkup data for people with a medical history vs those with no medical history and their differences (allowing a 1% deviation)
  Notes: In the solution, computing the following 8 or more health checkup indicators with correct values earns points (providing only difference data also earns points); values just need to match, do not consider sign.
