# [Total Score | 24 points] The solution must meet two core requirements:
- Requirement 1: Quantitative descriptive analysis and pattern identification
- Requirement 2: Actionable optimization recommendations based on the patterns
---
## Requirement 1: Pattern analysis of changes (This requirement can earn up to 16 points)
### Criterion 1.1 [Up to 2 points]: Correctly filter data launched in 2024
#### Path 1.1.A [2 points | Filter by year field]
- Sub-criterion 1.1.A.1 [1 point | Completeness]: Filter level data by the Launch Time field to select records whose launch year is 2024.
- Sub-criterion 1.1.A.2 [1 point | Accuracy]: The filtering logic is correct, retaining only records where `year(Launch Time) == 2024`.
  ```pseudocode
  For each level record:
    Read field [Launch Time]
    If year(Launch Time) == 2024:
        Retain the record
  ```
#### Path 1.1.B [2 points | Filter by date range]
- Sub-criterion 1.1.B.1 [1 point | Completeness]: Filter data by the Launch Time field to select records where Launch Time is between 2024-01-01 and 2024-12-31.
- Sub-criterion 1.1.B.2 [1 point | Accuracy]: The filtering logic is correct: `2024-01-01 ≤ Launch Time ≤ 2024-12-31`.
  ```pseudocode
  For each level record:
    Read field [Launch Time]
    If Launch Time >= 2024-01-01 and Launch Time <= 2024-12-31:
        Retain the record
  ```

### Criterion 1.2 [Up to 14 points]: Statistical comparisons at the combination level
#### Path 1.2.A [14 points | Unweighted complete method]
- Sub-criterion 1.2.A.1 [1 point | Completeness]: Group by the combination "Difficulty Level (Easy/Normal/Hard/Hell) + Level Type (Battle/Parkour/Puzzle/Exploration/BOSS)".
- Sub-criterion 1.2.A.2 [2 points | Completeness]: Compute and fully list **the 16 "Difficulty × Type" combinations that are actually non-empty in 2024** with Churn Rate and Level Rating (choose mean or median). Fewer than 16 yields zero points.
- Sub-criterion 1.2.A.3 [1 point | Completeness]: Compute the slope or change magnitude for different gradients of Churn Rate/Level Rating.
- Sub-criterion 1.2.A.4 [4 points | Accuracy]: Per-group values match reference values within tolerance (±0.005).
