The company's CEO has tasked the Human Resources department with developing a comprehensive strategy for 2024 to improve recruiting efficiency and optimize costs. The analysis must address how to achieve a 15% reduction in total recruitment costs while simultaneously enhancing overall hiring quality. This must be done under the constraints of meeting candidate diversity targets (a female hire representation of no less than 40% and a non-white hire representation of no less than 30%) and maintaining an interviewer satisfaction score above 4.0.

Based on data from the past year, you are required to design a complete recruitment strategy proposal. This proposal should include channel weight allocation, recommendations for optimizing the interview process, and an assessment of the expected ROI. Your analysis must comprehensively consider the differences in hiring needs across various departments, the time efficiency and cost-effectiveness of different sourcing channels, the impact of interviewer's professional background alignment on hiring decisions, and the retention rates of candidates at each stage of the recruitment process.
