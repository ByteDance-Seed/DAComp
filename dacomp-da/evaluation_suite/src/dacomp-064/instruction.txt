In the project delivery cycle of the last 6 months, we have observed that certain key stakeholders with high technical influence (`engagement_impact_score` ≥ 3) and frequent cross-functional collaboration (`cross_functional_projects` ≥ 3) have shown a phenomenon of decreasing engagement depth while their influence breadth continues to expand. Simultaneously, their problem-solving efficiency (based on the ratio of `issues_assigned` to `issues_reported` and `avg_close_time`) and influence propagation patterns (the dynamic balance between `total_outbound_influence` vs. `total_inbound_influence`) have exhibited abnormal fluctuations. Please conduct an in-depth analysis of the root causes behind this contradictory phenomenon of 'expanding influence but declining participation efficiency'. Identify which factors (such as changes in `response_pattern_type`, growth patterns of `network_connections`, distribution of project types, and the alignment between `strategic_value_score` and actual contributions) are driving this trend. Additionally, evaluate the potential impact of this pattern on overall project success rates and team collaboration efficiency, and propose data-driven strategies for personnel capability reallocation and collaboration model optimization.
