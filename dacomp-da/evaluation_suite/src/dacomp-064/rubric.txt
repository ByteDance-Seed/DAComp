---
## Requirement 1: Data Availability Check and Sample Construction (Max 6 Points)
### Criterion 1.1 (Max 6 Points): Selection and Validation of Time Window and Sample Definition
#### Path 1.1.A (Recommended | "Last 6 Months = Recent 3 Months vs. Prior 3 Months" Difference Method)
- 1.1.A.1 [1 Point | Completeness] State that `dt_max = 2025-01-25 13:00:49` (derived from `MAX(COALESCE(updated_at,resolved_at,created_at))`), and based on this, define `prior=[2024-07-25, 2024-10-25)` and `recent=[2024-10-25, 2025-01-25]`. Declare the matching definition for `stakeholder_id` ↔ `assignee_user_id` / `reporter_user_id`.
- 1.1.A.2 [4 Points | Precision] During scoring, verify that the following results are consistent with the execution (error=0): `issue_prior_created=0`, `issue_recent_created=0`, `prior_assignees=0`, `recent_assignees=0`, `prior_reporters=0`, `recent_reporters=0`, and that the `date_day` records in `jira__daily_issue_field_history` for the same window are 0. The process of "Filter by window → Aggregate by stakeholder×period → Calculate difference" must be clearly explained, and a reproducible SQL framework must be provided:
  ```sql
  WITH params AS (
    SELECT datetime('2025-01-25 13:00:49') AS dt_max,
           datetime('2025-01-25 13:00:49','-3 months') AS recent_start,
           datetime('2025-01-25 13:00:49','-6 months') AS prior_start
  )
  SELECT ...
  FROM jira__issue_enhanced, params
  WHERE DATE(created_at) BETWEEN prior_start AND dt_max
  GROUP BY stakeholder_id, period;
  ```
- 1.1.A.3 [1 Point | Conclusiveness] Point out the judgment that "sample size for the window is 0 → the difference method is not feasible, must switch to a snapshot-based definition" and explain its business implication (no incremental data to measure trends).
#### Path 1.1.B (Snapshot Difference Proxy Method | Database Default)
- 1.1.B.1 [1 Point | Completeness] Acknowledge the lack of windowed data (as all counts above are 0) and switch to the `jira__stakeholder_engagement_insights` snapshot. List the key derived fields: `breadth_depth_delta`, `participation_density_conn`, `depth_efficiency_index`, `assign_report_ratio`, `out_in_ratio`.
- 1.1.B.2 [4 Points | Precision] Verify all of the following: `cohort_size=4524`, `avg_outbound_influence=17.47±0.05`, `avg_inbound_influence=13.836±0.01`, `avg_direct_network_connections=27.268±0.01`, `avg_strategic_value_score=70.853±0.01`, `avg_breadth=23.369±0.01`, `avg_depth=22.977±0.01`. Explain calculations such as `participation_density_conn = total_comments_authored/NULLIF(direct_network_connections,0)` and `depth_efficiency_index=(engagement_depth_score+engagement_quality_score)/2`. A reproducible SQL outline must be provided:
  ```sql
  WITH base AS (
    SELECT *,
           engagement_breadth_score - engagement_depth_score AS breadth_depth_delta,
           CASE WHEN direct_network_connections>0 THEN total_comments_authored*1.0/direct_network_connections END AS participation_density_conn,
           (engagement_depth_score + engagement_quality_score)/2.0 AS depth_efficiency_index
    FROM jira__stakeholder_engagement_insights
  )
  SELECT ... FROM base;
  ```
- 1.1.B.3 [1 Point | Conclusiveness] Emphasize that the snapshot method is for structural early warnings and cannot be used to directly infer temporal trends, and the static nature of the sample must be noted in the report.
#### Path 1.1.C (Fallback | "Last 12 Months split into 2×6 Months" Difference Method)
- 1.1.C.1 [1 Point | Completeness] If a fallback path is described, provide the definition `prior=[2024-01-25, 2024-07-25)` and `recent=[2024-07-25, 2025-01-25]` and the conditions for its application.
- 1.1.C.2 [4 Points | Precision] Confirm that `issues_prior=0` and `issues_recent=0`, and explain that the calculation process is similar to 1.1.A (with the window changed to 6 months).
- 1.1.C.3 [1 Point | Conclusiveness] State that "the 12-month difference is also empty → must still fall back to the snapshot method" to ensure analytical continuity.

  ```sql
  WITH stats AS (...), thresholds AS (...)
  SELECT stakeholder_id,
         CASE WHEN breadth_depth_delta >= delta_high
              AND ((participation_density_conn <= pd_low) OR depth_efficiency_index <= depth_low)
              THEN 1 ELSE 0 END AS contradiction_flag
  FROM derived;
  ```

#### Path 2.1.C (Model/Anomaly Detection Method)

- 5.1.A.2 [4 Points | Precision] Each strategy must have quantitative targets and execution logic, for example:
  1. For the 403 Exec/Senior members in the contradiction set (112+291), implement a "concurrent projects ≤8" throttle (compared to the current average of 9.147 for the set). Over-limit requests are placed in a buffer queue with an alternative owner assigned.
  2. For the 199 Strategic Advisors & Technical Experts, introduce an execution anchor, requiring `assign/report ≥3.90` (current average for the set is 3.701), to increase their execution ratio via co-owned backlogs or a secondary owner mechanism.
  3. Depth Support: If `breadth_depth_delta ≥7.72` or `depth_efficiency_index ≤18.412`, automatically assign a cross-functional pair to raise `avg_depth_eff` to ≥18.5 within 4 weeks. Provide pseudocode for the trigger script (e.g., `IF total_projects_involved>8 THEN queue_reassignment(...)`).
- 5.1.A.3 [1 Point | Conclusiveness] Set a governance target: reduce the number of people in the contradiction set by ≥30% (to ≤599) within 8 weeks, with `avg_depth_eff ≥18.5` for the set. Specify review milestones.

- 5.1.B.1 [1 Point | Completeness] Propose at least two measures covering communication throttling, deep work windows, and two-person closed-loop mechanisms.
- 5.1.B.2 [4 Points | Precision] For example:
  1. For the 523 individuals with `total_comments_authored>100` or `direct_network_connections>40`, set a comment budget with a target of ≥20% reduction in comment volume (from 82 to ≤66), and log the requests that were curtailed.
  2. For the 485 individuals (in the contradiction set) with `out/in_ratio>1.5`, pair them with an execution owner to bring the spillover influence ratio back to ≤1.50.
  3. For members with `cross_functional_projects ≥5`, schedule two 2-hour "deep blocks" per week; cross-domain requests must be approved 48 hours in advance. Provide scheduling/rostering pseudocode or a script skeleton.
- 5.1.B.3 [1 Point | Conclusiveness] Describe the expected benefits (reduced communication costs, `assign/report` ratio rising to ≥3.9) and the rolling monitoring approach.

### Criterion 5.2 (Max 6 Points): Monitoring and Alerting Closed-Loop System

- 5.2.A.2 [4 Points | Precision] Set thresholds and explain their origins:
  - Alert Condition: `breadth_depth_delta≥7.72 AND (participation_density_conn≤0.98 OR depth_efficiency_index≤18.412)` is triggered for two consecutive periods.
  - Resource Scheduling: `total_projects_involved>10`, `total_comments_authored>100`, `direct_network_connections>40`, `avg_close_time_days>5.0`, `assign/report<3.80`.
  - Organizational Level: If the contradiction rate for Exec/Senior level reaches ≥40%, trigger a special review.
  Provide pseudocode for a periodic task (query → alert → write to audit table).
- 5.2.A.3 [1 Point | Conclusiveness] Describe the "monitor → alert → intervene → review" closed loop. Success criteria: contradiction set size ≤599, Exec/Senior contradiction rate <35%, `avg_depth_eff` of the contradiction set ≥18.5.
#### Path 5.2.B (Pilot and Iterative Governance)
- 5.2.B.1 [1 Point | Completeness] Formulate a pilot plan: select the 403 Exec/Senior members of the contradiction set as the pilot group, with the 493 non-contradiction members at the same level as the control group, over a 6-week period.
- 5.2.B.2 [4 Points | Precision] Define clear evaluation metrics: alert trigger rate, `avg_close_time_days`, `assign/report`, `total_comments_authored`. Explain the comparison method (pilot vs. control difference, pre/post 3-week windows), and provide data logging/difference calculation pseudocode.
- 5.2.B.3 [1 Point | Conclusiveness] Explain how to dynamically adjust thresholds or resource allocation based on monitoring results to achieve iterative optimization.
