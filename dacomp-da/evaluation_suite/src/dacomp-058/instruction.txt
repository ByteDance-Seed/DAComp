Upon discovering a severe imbalance between input and output in some high-cost campaigns, there is a need to establish a comprehensive campaign health assessment and optimization system. Based on data from multiple tables in the `google_ads` database, use a monthly cost > $1000 and an ROI < 0.8 as initial screening criteria to build a three-dimensional health score model consisting of Cost Efficiency (40%), Conversion Quality (35%), and Competitiveness (25%). The analysis must compare the performance differences across various channel types (`campaign_type`), bidding strategies (`bidding_strategy`), industry categories (`industry`), geographic distributions (`geo_target`), and device types (`device_type`) to identify high-cost, low-conversion risk campaigns. Based on multidimensional competitive metrics such as `quality_score`, `impression_share`, `ctr`, `conversion_rate`, and `avg_position`, propose targeted optimization recommendations. Additionally, consider the trend changes over 18 months, calculating year-over-year growth rates and seasonal fluctuations, to formulate differentiated optimization plans for each problematic campaign, including budget reallocation, keyword optimization, geographic adjustments, and device bidding strategies. The final output should include the health score, risk level, core problem diagnosis, and specific optimization recommendations for each campaign.
