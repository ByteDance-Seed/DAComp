## Requirement 1: Data Preparation and Segment Definition (Up to 6 Points)

### Standard 1.1: Build a Reproducible Data Foundation and Complete Customer Segmentation

#### Path 1.1.A: Single-Table Validation and Rule-Based Segmentation

- Standard 1.1.A.1 [1 Point | Completeness]: Confirm that the sole valid data source is `customer360__customer_value_analysis` (5001 rows) and identify the key fields: `primary_email`, `customer_tier`, `portfolio_contribution_pct`, `recency_score`, `frequency_score`, `monetary_score`, `rfm_avg_score`, `estimated_customer_ltv`, `customer_health_score`, `churn_probability`, `recommended_engagement_model`, `lifecycle_stage`, `account_age_days`, and `days_since_last_activity`. State that all subsequent analysis will be based on this table.
- Standard 1.1.A.2 [4 Points | Accuracy]: Complete all of the following validations: 1) The value range of `portfolio_contribution_pct` is [0.000400318586, 0.5], and the table-wide average is 0.009133645071 (tolerance ≤1e-6); 2) `primary_email` has no missing values (0 rows), with 4734 unique values after deduplication, indicating 111 duplicate records with a maximum repetition count of 24. The deduplication/aggregation logic must be explained in the analysis; 3) The `customer360__conversion_funnel_analysis` and `customer360__customer_activity_metrics` tables both contain 0 records; 4) Segment customers where `customer_tier`∈{Gold,Platinum} AND `portfolio_contribution_pct`>5% to define the HV group (N=103), and where `customer_tier`∈{Basic,Bronze,Silver} AND ≤5% to define the SMB group (N=4875), with the remaining categorized as Other (N=23) (tolerance ±1).
- Standard 1.1.A.3 [1 Point | Conclusion]: Clearly state that the funnel and activity tables are empty, requiring the use of RFM/LTV as proxies to measure consistency and value. Explain how deduplication or aggregation of the 111 duplicate emails ensures the credibility of the conclusions.

#### Path 1.1.B: Constructing a Data Foundation with Proxy Metrics

- Standard 1.1.B.1 [1 Point | Completeness]: Provide a complete system of proxy metrics: `rfm_mean=mean(R,F,M)`, `rfm_variance=var(R,F,M)`, `consistency_proxy=1/(1+rfm_variance)`, `ltv_velocity=estimated_customer_ltv/(account_age_days/30.44)`, `inactivity_ratio=days_since_last_activity/account_age_days`. State that all are derived from `customer360__customer_value_analysis`.
- Standard 1.1.B.2 [4 Points | Accuracy]: The calculation logic is correct, and the metrics for the HV/SMB groups fall within the following ranges (tolerance ±0.002): avg_consistency_proxy(HV)=0.749, avg_consistency_proxy(SMB)=0.805; avg_ltv_velocity(HV)=1046.6, avg_ltv_velocity(SMB)=142.0; avg_inactivity_ratio(HV)=0.790, avg_inactivity_ratio(SMB)=0.933.
- Standard 1.1.B.3 [1 Point | Conclusion]: Analyze the business rationale of the proxies (e.g., a high `inactivity_ratio` represents a gap in engagement) and point out the potential bias in diagnosing consistency due to the lack of detailed funnel/activity data.

#### Path 1.1.C: Quantile and Multi-Condition Segmentation

- Standard 1.1.C.1 [1 Point | Completeness]: Propose percentile-based definitions: HV=`customer_tier`∈{Gold,Platinum} AND `portfolio_contribution_pct`≥P98 (0.051471937), SMB=`customer_tier`∈{Basic,Bronze,Silver} AND ≤P80 (0.011773760). State that the percentiles are derived from the full sample of 5001 rows.
- Standard 1.1.C.2 [4 Points | Accuracy]: Provide SQL/pseudocode demonstrating how to extract percentile values and assign labels. Verify sample sizes: HV=101, SMB=4001 (tolerance ±5). If duplicate `primary_email` values cause conflicts, describe the deduplication priority rule.
- Standard 1.1.C.3 [1 Point | Conclusion]: Compare the applicable scenarios for the rule-based vs. quantile-based methods and explain how to maintain metric consistency when coordinating strategies.

Tolerance of ±0.02 is allowed.
- Standard 2.1.A.3 [1 Point | Conclusion]: Summarize that the HV group exhibits a "high M, medium-high R/F" pattern, while the SMB group shows a "uniformly low value" pattern, and explain the significance for value assessment.

#### Path 2.1.B: Differentiated Weighted RFM

- Standard 2.1.B.1 [1 Point | Completeness]: Explain that the weights for the HV group (0.2, 0.3, 0.5) emphasize monetary value, while the weights for the SMB group (0.4, 0.4, 0.2) focus on activity frequency.
- Standard 2.1.B.2 [4 Points | Accuracy]: Calculate the weighted RFM scores. Verify that the HV group average is 4.2874, the SMB group average is 1.8292, and the difference multiplier is 2.344 (tolerance ±0.02). Provide pseudocode/SQL to demonstrate the calculation.
- Standard 2.1.B.3 [1 Point | Conclusion]: Articulate the advantage of the weighted model in distinguishing between "high monetary value" and "high activity level" paths.

#### Path 2.1.C: RFM Standardization or Clustering Model

- Standard 2.1.C.1 [1 Point | Completeness]: Describe the process: apply z-score normalization to R/F/M → cluster using KMeans(k=6, random_state=42) → label the high-value cluster.
- Standard 2.1.C.2 [4 Points | Accuracy]: Reproduce the KMeans results, identifying the high-value cluster with a sample size of 259. Its centroid is approximately [z(R)=2.094, z(F)=2.108, z(M)=2.500]. Within this cluster, the HV group constitutes 39.768% and the SMB group constitutes 60.232% (tolerance ±2pct). Explain the label mapping logic.
- Standard 2.1.C.3 [1 Point | Conclusion]: Explain that although the high-value cluster includes some SMB customers, it can reveal potential upsell customers and inform subsequent operational priorities.

#### Path 5.1.C: Time Efficiency and Channel Synergy Strategy

- Standard 5.1.C.1 [1 Point | Completeness]: Propose an efficiency-tiered process centered on `marketing_to_sales_days` and `sales_to_support_days`. If fields are missing, note this and use `ltv_velocity` and `inactivity_ratio` as substitutes.
- Standard 5.1.C.2 [4 Points | Accuracy]: Provide threshold recommendations: if original fields exist, HV should be ≤45/≤30 days, SMB ≤30/≤14 days. If fields are missing, this must be documented in the report and proxy-based labels should be used, such as `rfm_velocity`>1000 (HV) / ≥150 (SMB) and `inactivity_ratio`<0.75 (HV) / <0.90 (SMB). Channel preference should be combined with `recommended_engagement_model` (e.g., Executive model must cover ≥3 high-value touchpoints, Standard model must have ≥90% automation). Provide pseudocode showing the logic for labeling based on efficiency and channel.
- Standard 5.1.C.3 [1 Point | Conclusion]: Explain how synergy between time efficiency and channels drives resource reallocation, ensuring that low-consistency customers receive targeted interventions at critical moments.
