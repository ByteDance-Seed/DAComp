The data team has identified a paradoxical phenomenon among high-value enterprise customers (those in Gold/Platinum tiers with a `portfolio_contribution_pct` > 5%): their `cross_stage_engagement_consistency` is generally lower than that of SMB customers, yet their `revenue_velocity_monthly` and `estimated_customer_ltv` are significantly higher. By building a composite RFM scoring model (based on `recency_score`, `frequency_score`, and `monetary_score`) and conducting a multi-dimensional customer health analysis (integrating `customer_health_score`, `activity_efficiency`, and `churn_probability`), please thoroughly explain the root cause of this 'low consistency, high value' phenomenon. Based on time-based conversion efficiency (`marketing_to_sales_days`, `sales_to_support_days`), engagement channel preferences, and account lifecycle characteristics, design differentiated operational strategies and resource allocation plans for different customer segments.
