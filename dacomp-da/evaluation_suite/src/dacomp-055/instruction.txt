The company is reassessing its customer investment strategy and needs to identify customer segments where investment allocation does not match actual returns. Filter for customers who are in the top 30% for `investment_priority_score` but in the bottom 50% for a composite performance metric (weighted as 40% `total_sales_amount`, 35% `product_adoption_rate`, and 25% `support_resolution_efficiency`). For these customers, calculate the ROI ratio of `customer_lifetime_value` to `acquisition_cost` and analyze their distribution characteristics across different `lifecycle_stage`s. Deep dive into the behavioral pattern disparities of this customer cohort: analyze the root causes of performance divergence by `industry_vertical` and `company_size_tier`, investigate the correlation between `customer_onboarding_score` and subsequent product adoption rates, and examine the impact mechanism of `team_size` and `decision_maker_level` on investment return effectiveness. Finally, identify systemic biases in the investment decision model and propose optimization recommendations.
