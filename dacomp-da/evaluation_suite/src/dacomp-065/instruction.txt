Our CEO claims that candidates from well-known tech companies (e.g., FAANG, unicorns) perform better in technical interviews, but the HR department is concerned about potential unconscious bias in our interview process. Please analyze our recruitment data to assess the impact of factors such as a candidate's company background, education level, and technical skills on their interview performance and final hiring outcome. Concurrently, detect any potential patterns of bias in the interview process. Specifically, you need to analyze: 1) whether there is a significant difference in the actual technical interview performance of candidates from different company backgrounds; 2) whether the impact of company background persists after controlling for educational background and work experience; and 3) identify and quantify any potential systemic biases in the interview process.
