## Business Impact and Recommendations

### Root Cause of Losses
The negative net profit for these SKUs is primarily driven by a combination of:
- **High wholesale costs** relative to unit sales price.
- **Low sales volumes** that fail to offset costs.
- **High product loss rates**, which further reduce profitability.

### Recommendations
1. **Reduce Supply for High-Loss SKUs**: The supermarket should immediately reduce the purchase quantities for the top 6 loss-making SKUs, especially `102900011030417` and `102900011030400`, which have the highest average net losses.
   
2. **Review Pricing Strategy**: Consider adjusting the pricing or promotional strategies for these items to improve profitability, if supply reduction is not feasible.

3. **Monitor Performance**: Continue monitoring the performance of these SKUs and reassess supply levels based on updated sales and cost data.

4. **Optimize Inventory**: Focus on SKUs with historically positive net profits to ensure inventory is optimized for profitability.

## Conclusion
By identifying and addressing loss-making SKUs, the supermarket can significantly reduce financial losses and improve overall revenue. The analysis provides a clear roadmap for supply reduction and inventory optimization based on quantitative data and business insights.
