**Silver Members Lead in Average Transaction Value**: Contrary to expectations, Silver Members show the highest average total transaction amount at **7,445 CNY**, followed by Gold Members at **7,303 CNY**. This suggests that mid-tier customers represent our most valuable transaction segment, with each membership level averaging between 17-20 high-value customers.
