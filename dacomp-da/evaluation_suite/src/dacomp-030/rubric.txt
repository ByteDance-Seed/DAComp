- Sub-standard 1.1.C.2 [1 point | Accuracy]: Anchor validation (error ≤3%): Types with insufficient Achievement Rate (Supermarket 82.8%, Retail Store 82.2%, Beverage Shop 81.5%), indicators of insufficient support resources (per-capita support budget, promotion frequency, training duration), and target rationality scoring (based on historical mean ± standard deviation range).
- Sub-standard 1.1.C.3 [2 points | Conclusiveness]:
  - Target rationality diagnosis: Systematically evaluate the reasonableness of target setting by Outlet Type, e.g., Supermarket has a large sales base (640 cases) but an Achievement Rate of only 82.8%; check whether the target is too high. Beverage Shop has the lowest Achievement Rate (81.5%) and a small sales base (283 cases), possibly reflecting insufficient support resources.
