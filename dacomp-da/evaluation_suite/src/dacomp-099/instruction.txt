Identify the key factors that lead customers to upgrade or downgrade. On a per-customer basis, construct an event timeline based on subscription change times (hypothetical `upgrade_at`, `downgrade_at`). Within a 30-day observation window before and after the change, compare changes in feature usage intensity (e.g., call counts, frequency changes relative to a baseline) with the occurrence of support incidents (e.g., outages, Bug tickets, support conversations). The goal is to analyze which experiences best explain the occurrence of upgrades or downgrades and to provide actionable business recommendations.
