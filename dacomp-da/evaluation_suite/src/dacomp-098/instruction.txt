Evaluate the impact of a bot-led first response strategy on various stages of the sales funnel. Using data from the mart layer on conversations (e.g., initiated_at, first_response_at, responder_type), leads (e.g., lead_source, industry, region), and conversions (e.g., demo_booked_at, trial_activated_at, paid_at), segment customers into two categories: those with a bot first response and those with a human first response. For the comparison, the definition of conversion rate is as follows: the percentage of customers who book a demo after starting a conversation, the percentage of customers who activate a trial after booking a demo, and the percentage of customers who ultimately pay after activating a trial. The definition of stage duration is the average time interval (in days) between first response and booking, booking and activation, and activation and payment. The analysis must also incorporate conversation content features (e.g., conversation_template_id, intent_label) to explain any observed differences. The conclusion should focus on identifying scenarios where the bot strategy is effective and scenarios where human intervention is more necessary.
