The product team's statistics show that we have 180 different features, but on average, a visitor uses only 12 of them. We want to quantify the contribution of different features to Customer Lifecycle Value (CLV), especially identifying "hidden value features"—those with low usage frequency (monthly active visitors < 200) but a significant positive impact on customer value. This analysis will provide data-driven support for next quarter's product investment.
