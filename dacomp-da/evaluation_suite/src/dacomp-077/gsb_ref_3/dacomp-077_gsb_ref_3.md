# Feature Contribution to Customer Value: Identifying Hidden Gems

## Executive Summary

Our analysis aimed to identify "hidden value features" – those with low usage but a significant positive impact on Customer Lifetime Value (CLV). We discovered that the **"Quick Actions"** feature fits this description perfectly. Despite having low monthly active users (MAU < 200), users of this feature exhibit a significantly higher average CLV. This report provides the data-driven evidence to support investing in and promoting this feature to drive overall customer value.

## Analysis and Findings

We analyzed feature usage and customer value data from the past three months (July to September 2025). Our methodology involved three main steps:

1.  **Calculating Feature Usage**: We determined the average monthly active users (MAU) for each of the 180 features by analyzing daily usage metrics.
2.  **Determining Feature Impact on CLV**: We calculated the average CLV for the users of each feature by linking feature usage data with customer lifecycle insights.
3.  **Identifying Hidden Value Features**: We filtered for features with an MAU below 200 and an average CLV in the top 25% of all features.

This process led us to a key finding:

*   **The "Quick Actions" feature is a hidden gem.** With an average MAU of 198, it falls into the low-usage category. However, the users of this feature have an average CLV of 524, which is in the top quartile of all features.

## Visualization: Feature Usage vs. Customer Value

The following scatter plot visualizes the relationship between feature usage (MAU) and the average CLV of users for all 180 features. It clearly highlights "Quick Actions" as an outlier in the "Hidden Value" quadrant (low usage, high value).

## Recommendations

Based on our findings, we recommend the following actions for the product team:

1.  **Invest in "Quick Actions"**: Dedicate resources to improving and expanding the "Quick Actions" feature. Since it's already associated with high-value customers, enhancing its functionality could further increase its impact.
2.  **Promote "Quick Actions" to a Wider Audience**: Launch a campaign to increase the adoption of "Quick Actions". This could include in-app tutorials, email newsletters, or targeted promotions to user segments that are not currently using the feature.
3.  **Conduct Further Qualitative Research**: Interview users of "Quick Actions" to understand why this feature is so valuable to them. These insights can inform the development of "Quick Actions" and potentially be applied to other features as well.

By focusing on this hidden value feature, we can unlock significant customer value and provide a data-driven direction for our product investment strategy.
