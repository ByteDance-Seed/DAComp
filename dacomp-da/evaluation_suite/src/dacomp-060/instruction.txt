It has been observed that some ad groups exhibit a high Click-Through Rate (CTR) but a low Conversion Rate (CVR), suggesting a potential mismatch between user intent and ad content. Using the `google_ads__ad_group_report` table and related conversion data, identify problematic ad groups based on the criteria of CTR > 75th percentile and CVR < 25th percentile. Analyze the common characteristics of these high-CTR, low-CVR ad groups, with a focus on assessing the Intent Match Ratio (Actual CVR / Expected CVR) and traffic quality. Finally, propose targeted optimization recommendations, including improvements for keyword strategy, audience targeting, and landing page experience.
