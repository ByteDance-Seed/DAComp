I need you to build a comprehensive employee value and risk assessment system to support the optimization of human resources decisions. First, define "core employees" as those with an `overall_employee_score` greater than 75 and a `career_development_score` exceeding the median. Then, conduct a deep-dive profile analysis of these core employees based on multi-dimensional features such as `age`, `tenure_years`, `marital_status`, `ethnicity_codes`, `total_positions_held`, `total_promotions`, `lateral_moves`, and `management_positions_held`. Next, perform a cross-group analysis by `career_phase` (Early/Mid/Senior Career) and `employee_maturity_segment` (New Hire/Developing/Established/Veteran) to analyze the distribution pattern of high `employee_risk_level` in each combination. Further explore the associated characteristics of these high-risk core employees across organizational environmental factors like `compensation_tier`, `work_conditions_score`, `dept_turnover_rate`, `dept_management_ratio`, `dept_health_score`, and `organization_type`. Additionally, you need to identify "high-value attrition risk employees," defined as those with a `retention_stability_score` below 60 but an `overall_employee_score` above 80. Analyze their `employee_value_segment` distribution and work condition features like `is_work_shift_required` and `is_union_eligible`. Finally, construct an integrated, tiered employee management recommendation system. Based on combinations of `highest_management_level_reached`, `dept_performance_category`, and `organization_sub_type`, provide targeted retention strategies and development path suggestions for different types of core employees, and evaluate the implementation priority and expected effectiveness of these strategies in various departments.
