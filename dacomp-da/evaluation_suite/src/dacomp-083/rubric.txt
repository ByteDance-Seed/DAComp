  5. Finance Department: 1330/57/4.2857%/58.15/0.0804/0.539
- Sub-criterion 4.2.A.3｜Conclusion: States that the top 6 departments (adding the Marketing Dept with 34 high-risk employees) cover 82.60% of high-risk core employees and estimates the expected impact (e.g., reducing the high-risk rate in priority departments by 1pp would mitigate risk for ~26 individuals, saving on replacement costs, etc.).

#### Path 4.2.B【5 points｜Rule-based Sorting Method】
- Sub-criterion 4.2.B.1｜Completeness: Proposes a filtering rule independent of the weighted method (e.g., high-risk rate >2% AND department health <55, sorted descending by the number of high-risk employees).
- Sub-criterion 4.2.B.2｜Accuracy: Lists at least 5 departments that meet the criteria and provides benchmarks for high-risk count, risk rate, health, turnover rate, etc., consistent with the database.
- Sub-criterion 4.2.B.3｜Conclusion: Formulates a phased implementation plan (Phase 1: QA/HR/R&D, Phase 2: Finance/Customer Service, etc.) and describes the expected impact.

### Criterion 4.3: Consistency Between Strategy and Analytical Conclusions (Up to 1 point)
#### Path 4.3.A【1 point｜Single Path】
