## Requirement 1: Analyze the month-over-month price growth trends for each Product Category across different Markets (maximum 8 points)
### Criterion 1.1: Calculation of the month-over-month growth rate of Average Price
#### Path 1.1.A [4 points | Group-and-aggregate method: Based on price data, compute the month-over-month growth rate of Average Price for each Product Category in each Market, and aggregate grouped by Category and Market]
- Sub-criterion 1.1.A.1 [1 point | Completeness]: Ensure the month-over-month price growth rate is computed for every Product Category in every Market.
- Sub-criterion 1.1.A.2 [3 points | Accuracy]: The month-over-month growth rate is computed correctly; verify against the following baseline values (verification tolerance within 0.5%).
  Note: Grain Total, Fruit Total, and Vegetable Total may be omitted, but if reported they must be broadly consistent with the table below.
  Formula check: Price month-over-month growth rate = (Average Price − Previous Period Average Price) / Previous Period Average Price.

### Criterion 1.2: Analyze price trends by Product Category
#### Path 1.2.A [4 points | Trend analysis: Based on the computed results, provide a detailed analysis of the month-over-month price growth trends for each category]

- Sub-criterion 2.1.A.3 [1 point | Conclusiveness]: State that Vegetable has the largest volatility, Fruit is next, and Grain prices are the most stable; reasonable phrasing suffices.

### Criterion 2.2: Analyze the impact of price volatility on supply
#### Path 2.2.A [4 points | Correlation analysis: Analyze the impact of overall volatility on supply (Supply = On-shelf Quantity (tons), Trading Volume (tons) or Supply = On-shelf Quantity (tons))]
- Sub-criterion 2.2.A.1 [1 point | Completeness]: Provide a reasonable definition of supply; Supply = On-shelf Quantity (tons), Trading Volume (tons) or Supply = On-shelf Quantity (tons) are both acceptable; analyze the impact of price volatility on On-shelf Quantity (tons) and Trading Volume (tons), including correlation coefficient calculations.
- Sub-criterion 2.2.A.2 [2 points | Accuracy]: Compute the Pearson correlation coefficient between price volatility and supply volume accurately and provide the correlation results (verification tolerance within 0.5%). If the model regards Supply = On-shelf Quantity (tons), then not providing -0.722 is also acceptable. Reference data:
  Correlation between price volatility and average On-shelf Quantity (tons): -0.7209
  Correlation between price volatility and average Trading Volume (tons): -0.722
  You may also provide the corresponding coefficients for Vegetable, Fruit, and Grain:
  - **Vegetable**: Price volatility is negatively correlated with supply rate (-0.159), i.e., the greater the volatility, the lower the supply rate
  - **Fruit**: A stronger negative correlation (-0.302); price volatility has a more pronounced impact on supply
  - **Grain**: Correlation is not significant; supply is essentially unaffected by price volatility
- Sub-criterion 2.2.A.3 [1 point | Conclusiveness]: Provide reasonable conclusions; for reference (reasonable phrasing suffices):
  1. In markets with greater price volatility, suppliers tend to reduce supply to avoid risk
  2. Price volatility significantly suppresses Trading Volume (tons); consumers’ willingness to buy declines during periods of high volatility
  4. Price volatility has a negative impact on both supply and demand, i.e., as volatility increases, On-shelf Quantity (tons) and Trading Volume (tons) decrease.
