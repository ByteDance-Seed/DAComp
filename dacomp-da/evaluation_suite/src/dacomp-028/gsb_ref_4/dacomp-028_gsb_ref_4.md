The scatter plot above illustrates the relationship between **price volatility** (measured as MoM growth in Average Price) and **supply** (measured as On-shelf Quantity in tons). Key observations include:

- There is a **weak negative correlation** between price volatility and supply — as price volatility increases, on-shelf quantities tend to decrease, though not consistently.
- Some data points show **high volatility with stable supply**, suggesting that external factors (e.g., subsidies, strategic stockpiling) may be at play.
- A few markets exhibit **low volatility and high supply**, indicating stable market conditions and efficient supply chain management.

This suggests that **price volatility can impact supply**, but the relationship is not strictly linear and may be influenced by other market-specific factors.

## Business Impact and Recommendations

### 1. Market-Specific Interventions
- **Vegetable markets** with high volatility may benefit from **price stabilization mechanisms** such as futures contracts or government subsidies.
- **Fruit markets** appear stable and may serve as a **benchmark** for managing other categories.

### 2. Supply Chain Optimization
- Markets showing **high volatility with stable supply** should be studied further to understand the **strategies** used to maintain supply despite price fluctuations.
- For markets with **low supply during high volatility**, improving **logistics and inventory management** could help maintain stable availability.

### 3. Data-Driven Policy Making
- Policymakers should consider **category-specific interventions** based on volatility patterns.
- Continuous monitoring of **price and supply trends** can help anticipate disruptions and inform proactive measures.
