The line chart shows DW-1203130446 sustaining elevated sales across multiple months, while DW-2316020016 spikes in February and then virtually disappears—confirming its one-time appeal.

### 2. Repurchase Rate vs. Sales Amount
- **High sales ≠ loyalty**: February’s winner achieves the largest single-month revenue but zero repeat buyers.  
- **March’s winner** combines high sales with the highest repurchase rate (26 %), indicating strong product-market fit.  
- **January and April winners** sit in the middle, with moderate sales and low-to-medium repeat rates.

### 3. Business Impact
- **Inventory Risk**: Products like DW-2316020016 require tight inventory control; demand is concentrated and non-recurring.  
- **Loyalty Driver**: DW-1203130446 should be prioritized for cross-selling and stock expansion—its repeat behavior signals enduring demand.  
- **Promotional Focus**: Redirect marketing spend from low-repurchase winners (DW-1001040125, DW-2316020016) toward DW-1203130446 and similar high-repeat items to maximize lifetime value.

## Recommendations
1. **Segment promotions by repurchase rate**: amplify campaigns for SKUs above 20 % repeat threshold.  
2. **Limit purchase quantities** in February for DW-2316020016 to avoid overstock once the spike ends.  
3. **Bundle** DW-1203130446 with complementary items to leverage its loyal customer base and raise basket size.  
4. **Review post-purchase engagement** for January and April winners to lift their sub-15 % repurchase rates via targeted follow-ups.

Acting on these insights will align inventory and marketing resources with products that deliver both immediate sales and long-term customer value.
