# Marketing Characteristics Analysis: Age-Based User Segmentation & Strategy Recommendations

## Executive Summary

Analysis of 337 users across four age segments reveals distinct marketing characteristics that demand differentiated strategies. Younger users (<25) show the highest churn risk (62.5%) but strong conversion potential, while older segments demonstrate higher engagement and sharing behaviors. The data supports implementing age-specific marketing campaigns with tailored messaging, channel selection, and product recommendations.

**Critical Insight**: Users under 25 face a 62.5% churn risk - 15 percentage points higher than the 50+ segment (47.2%). This represents a significant retention challenge requiring immediate intervention.

**Business Impact**: With 56 users in the <25 segment, approximately 35 are at risk of churning, representing potential revenue loss and increased acquisition costs.

### 2. Engagement and Sharing Patterns
