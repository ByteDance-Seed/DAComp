# [Total Score | 25 points] The solution must satisfy two core requirements:
- Requirement 1: Analyze the marketing characteristics of user groups across different age segments (churn risk, share rate, feedback rating)
- Requirement 2: Design differentiated product and marketing campaign recommendation strategies
---
## Requirement 1: Analyze the marketing characteristics of user groups across different age segments (churn risk, share rate, feedback rating) (This requirement is worth up to 13 points)
- Code verification method: Suitable when it is difficult to enumerate all reference answers; assume the code is correct if logic is correct. First, read comments and quickly scan the relevant code to verify whether the overall logic matches the analytical approach; then verify line-by-line to check whether each line truly implements what the comment describes.
### Criterion 1.1: Reasonableness and coverage of age group segmentation (up to 2 points)
#### Path 1.1.A [2 points | Four segments specified by the prompt]
- Sub-criterion 1.1.A.1 [1 point | Completeness]: Use the four age segments <25, 25–35, 36–50, 50+. Also compute sample sizes
- Sub-criterion 1.1.A.2 [1 point | Accuracy]: The following are reference figures; if the model only computes these in code without displaying the results, it is acceptable.
25-35: 69 people
36-50: 106 people
50+: 106 people
<25: 56 people

### Criterion 1.2: Churn risk analysis (up to 3 points)
#### Path 1.2.A [3 points | Average churn risk]
- Sub-criterion 1.2.A.1 [1 point | Completeness]: Group by days since last login, assign different risk indices, and compute the average churn risk for each age segment
- Sub-criterion 1.2.A.2 [2 points | Accuracy]: Using 2024-11-01 as the baseline, compute days since last login, and group by different ranges with weights (<30, 30-90, >90) to calculate the average churn risk. If the solution uses a different baseline date | grouping | weights | calculation definitions or other methods to analyze time since last login, these values are not directly comparable; score using the code verification method, and award points if the logic is correct.
   25-35  0.645
   36-50  0.753
   50+  0.745

- Sub-criterion 1.2.C.2 [1 point | Accuracy]: Using 2024-10-06 as the time baseline, and >90 days since last login as the threshold, compute the churn risk proportion. If the solution uses a different baseline time | threshold | calculation definitions, these values are not directly comparable; score using the code verification method, and award points if the logic is correct.

### Criterion 1.3: Share rate analysis (up to 4 points)
#### Path 1.3.A [4 points | Multi-factor share propensity analysis]
- Sub-criterion 1.3.A.1 [1 point | Completeness]: Using three dimensions—Age group, Membership Level, and Marketing SMS subscription status—stack influence factors (other reasonable dimensions are also acceptable) to compute share rates for different age segments
- Sub-criterion 1.3.A.2 [3 points | Accuracy]: Starting from a base value (0.3), add corresponding adjustment terms and random noise to obtain each user's share rate (between 0–1), and finally take the group average as the average share rate metric for that age segment. If the solution uses a different base value | influence parameters | calculation definitions | dimensions, these values are not directly comparable; score using the code verification method, and award points if the logic is correct.
Data explanation

- Sub-criterion 1.4.B.1 [1 point | Completeness]: Combine Membership Level, Login Count, Payment enabled (or other reasonable dimensions). Apply a weighted scoring model plus small random fluctuation to compute individual feedback ratings (range 1–5), then group by Age group and take averages
- Sub-criterion 1.4.B.2 [3 points | Accuracy]: The following is an illustrative reference. If the solution's calculation definitions, dimensions, or rules differ, these values are not directly comparable; score using the code verification method, and award points if the logic is correct.
Computation method:

| **Base score** | Fixed at `3.5` | +3.5 | 
| **Membership Level bonus** | Diamond +0.8; Platinum +0.5; Gold +0.3; Regular +0 | 0~+0.8 | 
| **Activity bonus** | Login Count >400 → +0.5; 200–400 → +0.3; ≤200 → +0 | 0~+0.5 | 
| **Payment bonus** | If `Payment enabled='Yes'` → +0.3, else +0 | 0~+0.3 | 
| **Random fluctuation** | Sample from a normal distribution N(0,0.3) (`np.random.normal(0,0.3)`) | ±0.3 (mean 0) | 
Average feedback rating = mean(clip(3.5 + f1(Membership Level) + f2(Login Count) + f3(Payment) + ϵ, 1, 5))
Computation results:
