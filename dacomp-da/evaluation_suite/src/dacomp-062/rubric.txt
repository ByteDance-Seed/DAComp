# [Total Score | 30 pts] Scoring rubric focuses on 'whether stakeholders with high `direct_network_connections` (DNC) lead to better project outcomes (`complexity_risk_score`, `success_probability`)', using a Demand → Standard → Path → Sub-standard structure. Each sub-standard is measured on Completeness (1 pt), Precision (4 pts), and Conclusiveness (1 pt); all scores are integers.

- Sub-standard 1.1.B.3 [1 pt｜Conclusiveness]: States that if this path could be executed, it should compare project outcomes for 'includes ≥1 high-DNC member vs. does not' and perform a significance test; if the mapping data is still unavailable, it should revert to the indirect evidence chain and state the limitation.

- Sub-standard 5.1.B.3 [1 pt｜Conclusiveness]: States that if results still show high DNC does not improve success, one should revert to indirect evidence and emphasize quality factors; if future results are positive, they should be paired with an external link governance strategy.

- Sub-standard 5.2.A.2 [4 pts｜Precision]: Recommendations must align with data insights and cite anchor points: negative correlation of external links with success (`r=-0.0067` overall, `r=-0.1202` in high complexity), weak negative `team_stability` (`r=-0.0636`, high complexity ≈-0.2318), weak positive `value_delivery` (`r=+0.0953`), explaining why one should 'control quantity, improve quality, and augment data'.
- Sub-standard 5.2.A.3 [1 pt｜Conclusiveness]: Summarizes that 'the network advantage of high-DNC members should be shifted towards quality-driven outcomes (dependency governance, pace control, value delivery), with effectiveness enhanced through data infrastructure and pilot validation'.

#### Path 5.2.B [3 pts]: Modeling and monitoring roadmap (Alternative)
