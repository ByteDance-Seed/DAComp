We are re-evaluating the return on investment (ROI) for each distribution channel but have found that looking at `completion_rate` and `efficiency_score` alone is insufficient. Could you conduct a comprehensive, in-depth analysis of channel effectiveness? You will need to build a channel ROI evaluation model by combining the performance data from the `qualtrics__channel_performance` table, the project type distribution from the `qualtrics__survey` table, and the user lifecycle value from the `qualtrics__contact` table. Pay special attention to the performance differences of each channel across different `project_category` values (feedback, research, evaluation), as well as the value contribution distribution of user cohorts within each channel. The final deliverable should be a data-driven channel budget reallocation plan, including the optimal investment ratio for each channel and a forecast of expected returns.
