Using the `sheet1` table, compute and describe the trend in the ratio of `Surface Water Supply (100 million m³)` to `Groundwater Supply (100 million m³)` for China between 2005 and 2018. Highlight whether the ratio is increasing, decreasing, or stable over the full span and note any inflection points or sub-period patterns you observe. Then, consult `economic_indicator_data` (particularly `Urbanization rate (%)`) and argue how changes in urbanization relate to the surface-to-groundwater ratio during the same years. Keep every statement aligned with the dataset, refer to the English column names, and reason quantitatively whenever possible.
