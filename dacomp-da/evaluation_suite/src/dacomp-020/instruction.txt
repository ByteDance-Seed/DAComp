Analyze the dataset in `sheet1` to answer the following three questions: (1) What is the overall relationship between `Mental health score` and `Exam score`? Use data-driven smoothing, grouping, or modeling approaches to describe whether the trend is monotonic, linear, or exhibits inflection points, and defend your conclusion with statistical evidence and interpretable effect sizes. (2) After controlling for learning habit and lifestyle factors captured in columns such as `Daily study time`, `Social media usage time`, `Attendance rate`, `Sleep duration`, `Exercise frequency`, `Diet quality`, `Part-time job`, `Internet quality`, and `Parents' education level`, assess whether `Mental health score` maintains a statistically significant marginal effect on `Exam score`, and quantify its coefficient, confidence intervals, p-values, and delta-`R²` (or alternative robust measures). (3) Identify which additional variables (learning habits, lifestyle factors, or demographics) interact with `Mental health score` to amplify or dampen its effect size, explaining the mechanistic implications of those interactions. Keep every explanation precise, cite the English column names, and preserve the original rubric’s emphasis on trend shape, statistical rigor, and policy-relevant implications.
