# [Total Score | 16 points] Solutions must satisfy three core requirements:
- Requirement 1: Describe the overall trend of average student performance as the Mental health score changes (5 points)
- Requirement 2: After controlling for learning habits and lifestyle factors, determine whether the Mental health score has a statistically significant marginal impact on academic performance (7 points)
- Requirement 3: Identify which variables interact with the Mental health score effect size (4 points)

## Requirement 1: Overall trend of average Exam score by Mental health score (maximum 5 points)
### Standard 1.1: Trend characterization (maximum 4 points)
#### Path 1.1.A [4 points | Nonparametric smoothing (preferred LOESS/local regression)]
- Sub-criterion 1.1.A.1 [1 point | Completeness]: Clearly document the sample selection, aggregation units, and smoothing settings (e.g., standardization or binning of `Mental health score`; `Exam score` summarized by mean or with confidence intervals).
- Sub-criterion 1.1.A.2 [2 points | Accuracy]: Provide a pseudo workflow verifying the analysis:
  1) Specify the smoothing configuration (span/bandwidth, weighting scheme, boundary treatment or number of support points);
  2) Estimate the LOESS curve between `Mental health score` and `Exam score`, including a 95% confidence or standard error band;
  3) Recompute and confirm that the output matches the configuration (node count, span, interval definition);
  4) If the prompt supplies fixed reference values or curve coordinates, cross-check each one.
- Sub-criterion 1.1.A.3 [1 point | Conclusion]: Based on the LOESS analysis, explicitly answer Requirement 1: state that average `Exam score` increases in a significantly positive, monotonic manner as `Mental health score` rises, and support this with at least two of the following conclusions:
  1) Monotonicity: `Mental health score` and `Exam score` exhibit an overall positive, monotonic increase with no obvious inflection, providing stable theoretical support for policy;
  2) Marginal effect quantification: as `Mental health score` rises from 1 to 10, `Exam score` climbs from about 63 points to 78 points (≈15-point gain), showing a clear return on investing in mental health;
  3) Growth gradient: grouped means show 1–3 ≈ 63.37, 4–7 ≈ 69.42, 8–10 ≈ 76.76, indicating a stepwise increase and supporting a three-tier intervention strategy;
  4) Stability advantage: the highest `Mental health score` group (8–10) has a lower standard deviation (≈15.10), suggesting mental health not only raises mean performance but also reduces academic risk;
  5) Policy implication: schools should integrate mental health assessment into academic warning systems and prioritize students scoring below 4 for targeted support.
#### Path 1.1.B [4 points | Group mean comparisons and trend testing]
- Sub-criterion 1.1.B.1 [1 point | Completeness]: Specify grouping rules (e.g., 1–3 / 4–7 / 8–10 or quintiles) and report each group’s mean and standard deviation.
- Sub-criterion 1.1.B.2 [2 points | Accuracy]: Provide a pseudo workflow that hits at least three of the following anchors (±0.05 tolerance):
  1) Compute group means according to the chosen bins;
  2) Calculate Spearman’s rank correlation (group order or center vs. group mean) or a linear slope test;
  3) Report statistical metrics: Spearman ρ ≈ 0.329 or Pearson r ≈ 0.326;
  4) Confirm group means: Low ≈ 63.37, Middle ≈ 69.42, High ≈ 76.76;
  5) Provide decile detail: 1 → 63.20, 10 → 78.06, showing monotonic increase;
  6) Evaluate statistical significance at α=0.05 (p < 0.001).
- Sub-criterion 1.1.B.3 [1 point | Conclusion]: Based on the group tests, explicitly answer Requirement 1: state that average `Exam score` increases significantly with `Mental health score` (p<0.001), and support with at least two of the following:
  1) Confirmed increasing trend: group means rise significantly with score (ρ≈0.33, p<0.001), which validates differential management;
  2) Effect magnitude: the high mental health group scores ≈13.4 points higher than the lowest group, and each point increase yields ≈6-point gain, giving a quantifiable ROI;
  3) Group differences: quintile analysis (Q1 63.1 → Q5 77.6) shows stable increments, supporting tiered interventions;
  4) Risk identification: students scoring 1–3 face clear academic risk and should be prioritized for preventive measures;
  5) Management suggestion: recommend a student classification system based on mental health scores to improve resource allocation.

- Sub-criterion 1.1.E.1 [1 point | Completeness]: Identify and explain any data preprocessing issues (e.g., misencoded categorical variables, sample loss from missing-value removal, inconsistent variable encoding) and propose sensible remedies.

#### Path 1.2.A [1 point | Conclusion]
- Sub-criterion 1.2.A.1 [1 point | Conclusion]: **Final answer to Requirement 1**: The average `Exam score` increases significantly and monotonically with `Mental health score` (r ≈ 0.33, p<0.001); scores move from roughly 63 to 78 from the lowest to highest mental health level, confirming that higher mental health consistently associates with higher academic performance. This finding justifies prioritizing mental health interventions in educational policy.
