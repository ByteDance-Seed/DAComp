We have identified a group of customers exhibiting specific conversion behaviors: their `marketing_to_sales_days` is between 10 and 20 days, `sales_to_support_days` exceeds 30 days, and their `composite_engagement_score` is higher than the average for all customers. Please conduct an analysis of this cohort: first, calculate the specific count of this group, the average scores for the three RFM dimensions, the average difference in their `estimated_customer_ltv` compared to other customers in the same `customer_tier`, the distribution of their `primary_engagement_channel`, and the proportion of their `zendesk_active` status. Then, deeply explore their geographical distribution characteristics (by `country` and `state`), analyze the impact of their multi-platform engagement patterns (combinations of `in_marketo`, `in_stripe`, `in_zendesk`) on `customer_health_score`, and design a framework for customer value assessment and risk identification based on metrics such as `activity_risk_level` and `engagement_velocity`.
