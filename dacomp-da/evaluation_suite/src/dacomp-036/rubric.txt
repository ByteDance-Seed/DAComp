- Sub-standard 1.1.A.2 [2 points | Accuracy]: Verify against the baseline values below (deviation must not exceed 1%)
  | Login Method | Success Count | Failure Count | Success Rate | Failure Rate |
  |--------------|---------------|---------------|--------------|--------------|
  | Password Login | 20 | 24 | 45.45% | 54.55% |
  | SMS verification code login | 21 | 24 | 46.67% | 53.33% |
  | Scan Code Login | 25 | 21 | 54.35% | 45.65% |
  | Fingerprint authentication | 19 | 23 | 45.24% | 54.76% |
#### Path 1.1.B [2 points | Success rate comparative analysis]
- Sub-standard 1.1.B.1 [1 point | Completeness]: Compare success rates across multiple Login Methods, and identify which methods have higher and lower success rates.
- Sub-standard 1.1.B.2 [1 point | Accuracy]: The comparative success rate analysis is correct; the identified methods with high and low success rates match actual conditions (use the baseline values in Path 1.1.A as reference; comparative result deviation must not exceed 1%).
---
### Standard 1.2 [Maximum 3 points]: Two-Factor Authentication analysis
### Must be data-based analysis of Two-Factor Authentication; if no conclusion is reached, then all points under Standard 1.2 will be forfeited.
#### Path 1.2.A [3 points | Comprehensive Two-Factor Authentication analysis]
- Sub-standard 1.2.A.1 [1 point | Completeness]: For each Two-Factor Authentication Method, compute the enablement proportion, analyze how enablement rate impacts security, and compare success rates between enabled and not enabled Two-Factor Authentication.
- Sub-standard 1.2.A.2 [2 points | Accuracy]: Verify against the baseline values below (deviation must not exceed 1%)
  | Two-Factor Authentication Method | Enabled Proportion |
  |-------------|---------|
  | APP verification code | 41% |
  | SMS | 49% |
  | Email | 47% |

  Success rate with Two-Factor Authentication enabled: 48.78%
  Success rate with Two-Factor Authentication not enabled: 47.37%
#### Path 1.2.B [2 points | Two-Factor Authentication enablement proportion analysis]
- Sub-standard 1.2.B.1 [1 point | Completeness]: For each Two-Factor Authentication Method, compute the enablement proportion and identify the methods with lower enablement rates.
- Sub-standard 1.2.B.2 [1 point | Accuracy]: Enablement proportion calculations are correct; the identified methods with lower enablement rates match actual conditions (use the baseline values in Path 1.2.A as reference; deviation must not exceed 1%).
---
### Standard 1.3 [Maximum 4 points]: Specific combinations and security event analysis
### If no event analysis is conducted for specific combinations, then no points will be awarded for any path under Standard 1.3.
#### Path 1.3.A [4 points | Detailed combination and event analysis]
- Sub-standard 1.3.A.1 [1 point | Completeness]: Analyze the success rates of specific combinations of Login Method and Authentication Method, identify combinations with extremely low success rates, and tally the number of security events under different combinations.
- Sub-standard 1.3.A.2 [3 points | Accuracy]: Verify against the baseline values below (deviation must not exceed 1%)

  | Login Method | Two-Factor Authentication Method | Whether Two-Factor Authentication is Enabled | Success Rate |
  |--------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|--------------|
  | Fingerprint authentication | SMS | Two-Factor Authentication Not Enabled (high level) | 0% |
  | SMS verification code login | APP verification code | Two-Factor Authentication Not Enabled (low level) | 0% |
  | Password Login | SMS | Two-Factor Authentication Enabled (high level) | 14.29% |
  | Fingerprint authentication | SMS | Two-Factor Authentication Not Enabled (overall) | 11.11% |


  | Login Method | Two-Factor Authentication Status | Severe anomaly count |
  |--------------|----------------------------------|----------------------|
  | SMS verification code login | Not Enabled | 9 times |
  | Fingerprint authentication | Not Enabled | 8 times |
  | Password Login | Enabled | 7 times |
#### Path 1.3.B [2 points | Combination success rate analysis]
- Sub-standard 1.3.B.1 [1 point | Completeness]: Analyze the success rates of specific combinations of Login Method and Authentication Method, and identify combinations with extremely low success rates.
- Sub-standard 1.3.B.2 [1 point | Accuracy]: The identified combinations with extremely low success rates are correct; compared with the baseline values in Path 1.3.A, the deviation must not exceed 1%.
---
## Requirement 2: Recommendations for Login - Authentication methods (Maximum 6 points for this requirement)
### Standard 2.1 [Maximum 4 points]: Login Method recommendations
#### Path 2.1.A [4 points | Comprehensive recommendation]
- Sub-standard 2.1.A.1 [1 point | Completeness]: Based on multiple factors such as Login Method success rate and user experience, recommend suitable Login Methods for different scenarios and explain the rationale.
- Sub-standard 2.1.A.2 [1 point | Accuracy]: The recommended Login Methods are reasonable, with sufficient rationale grounded in the preceding analysis.
- Sub-standard 2.1.A.3 [2 points | Conclusiveness]: Clearly specify the recommended Login Methods for different scenarios, such as medium/low-risk scenarios and high-risk scenarios.
#### Path 2.1.B [2 points | Simple recommendation]
- Sub-standard 2.1.B.1 [1 point | Completeness]: Recommend one or several Login Methods and briefly explain the rationale.
- Sub-standard 2.1.B.2 [1 point | Accuracy]: The recommended Login Methods are reasonably justified and have some connection to the preceding analysis.

#### Path 2.2.B [1 point | Simple Two-Factor Authentication recommendation]
- Sub-standard 2.2.B.1 [1 point | Accuracy]: Provide a simple recommendation for Two-Factor Authentication, such as encouraging users to enable Two-Factor Authentication.
