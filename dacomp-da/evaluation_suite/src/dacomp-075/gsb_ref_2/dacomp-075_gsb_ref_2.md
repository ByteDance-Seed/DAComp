# Vendor Resilience Assessment & Risk Management Framework

## Executive Summary

In response to increasing global supply chain uncertainty, we have developed and implemented a comprehensive multi-dimensional vendor resilience assessment framework focusing on 83 key vendors classified as 'Mission Critical' or 'High Strategic Value'. Our analysis reveals significant resilience gaps that require immediate attention, with 17 vendors showing high-risk scores (>60) and an average warning score of 44.5 across the portfolio.

## Key Findings

### 1. Vendor Portfolio Overview
- **Total Analyzed Vendors**: 83 strategic vendors
- **Average Spend Concentration**: 81.7% (ranging from 5.1% to 100%)
- **High-Risk Vendors**: 17 vendors with risk scores >60
- **Critical Warning Indicators**: 2 vendors in immediate action category

### 2. Four-Dimensional Resilience Assessment

#### Financial Resilience
Our financial resilience analysis reveals concerning patterns in payment performance and financial health:
- **Mission Critical vendors** show the highest average risk score (81.0) compared to High Strategic Value vendors (54.9)
- **Payment delays** average 15-30 days across strategic vendors, with some exceeding 60 days
- **Overdue payment percentages** range from 5% to 25%, indicating cash flow challenges

- **Cybersecurity scores** reveal critical gaps, with 31% of vendors scoring below 70
- **Innovation capability** averages 58/100, limiting long-term partnership potential

#### Market Resilience
Market vulnerability analysis identifies substantial exposure:
- **Market volatility index** averages 6.2/10, with high-sensitivity vendors scoring >7
- **Alternative supplier availability** is critically low, with 45% having <2 alternatives
- **Price volatility coefficient** ranges from 0.8 to 1.9, indicating significant cost exposure

#### Strategic Resilience
Strategic positioning reveals long-term vulnerabilities:
- **Contract expiry timeline**: All 83 vendors have contracts expiring within 18 months
- **Geographic concentration**: 67% of vendors located in single regions
- **Environmental ratings**: Only 28% achieve 'Excellent' sustainability ratings

### 3. Risk vs Resilience Analysis

Our comprehensive risk-resilience scatter analysis reveals four distinct vendor categories:

![Risk vs Resilience Scatter Plot](risk_vs_resilience_scatter.png)

**Critical Zone Vendors** (High Risk, Low Resilience): 8 vendors requiring immediate intervention
**Monitoring Zone** (High Risk, High Resilience): 9 vendors needing close surveillance
**Improvement Zone** (Low Risk, Low Resilience): 31 vendors requiring resilience building
**Stable Zone** (Low Risk, High Resilience): 35 vendors in optimal condition

### 4. Contract Expiry Risk Assessment

The contract expiry timeline analysis reveals urgent renewal requirements:

- **Immediate Risk** (≤6 months): 18 vendors requiring urgent contract renegotiation
- **Medium-term Risk** (6-12 months): 34 vendors needing proactive engagement
- **Long-term Risk** (12-18 months): 31 vendors with time for strategic planning

## Dynamic Risk Warning System

### Early Warning Indicators

Our early warning system identifies vendors showing stress signals across multiple dimensions:

![Risk Warning Dashboard](risk_warning_dashboard.png)

**Warning Score Distribution:**
- **Critical (81-100)**: 8.4% of vendors
- **High (61-80)**: 22.9% of vendors  
- **Medium (31-60)**: 45.8% of vendors
- **Low (0-30)**: 22.9% of vendors

### 12-18 Month Risk Forecast

Scenario-based risk modeling predicts increasing vulnerability:

**Highest Probability Scenarios:**
1. **Financial Stress** (35% probability, 1.3x impact multiplier)
2. **Quality Crisis** (30% probability, 1.4x impact multiplier)
3. **Supply Chain Disruption** (25% probability, 1.5x impact multiplier)

### Contingency Planning Matrix
