In the context of increasing uncertainty in the current global supply chain, our company is facing unprecedented vendor resilience challenges. Please design and implement a multi-dimensional vendor resilience assessment framework, focusing on the group of vendors where `spend_concentration_ratio` exceeds 15% or are classified as 'Mission Critical'/'High Strategic Value'. Your analysis should integrate four core dimensions: Financial Resilience (payment performance, financial health), Operational Resilience (quality performance, cybersecurity capability, innovation capability), Market Resilience (market volatility sensitivity, alternative supplier availability, price volatility risk), and Strategic Resilience (geographic distribution risk, contract expiry risk, environmental sustainability). At the same time, please create a dynamic risk warning mechanism capable of identifying high-risk scenarios of potential supply disruption within the next 12-18 months, and formulate personalized resilience improvement paths and contingency plans for each identified key vendor. Finally, please quantitatively analyze the return on investment (ROI) of different resilience improvement strategies to provide senior management with data-driven recommendations for vendor portfolio optimization.
