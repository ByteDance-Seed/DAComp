### Financial Resilience Insights
- **Financial Health Score**: Most vendors fall within the moderate financial health range (50-70), indicating a need for improvement initiatives.
- **Average Payment Delay**: Vendors show an average delay of 20-40 days, suggesting room for operational efficiency improvements.
- **Overdue Payment Percentage**: Overdue payments range from 0% to 38%, highlighting areas for financial risk management.

- **Innovation Capability Score**: Scores indicate varying capacity for innovation, pointing to opportunities for capability-building programs.

### Market Resilience Insights
- **Market Volatility Index**: Vendors face moderate to high market volatility, necessitating agile supply chain strategies.
- **Price Volatility Coefficient**: Price instability suggests strategic sourcing and hedging practices are necessary.
- **Alternative Suppliers Count**: The availability of alternative suppliers varies, highlighting critical single-source dependencies.

### Strategic Resilience Insights
- **Geographic Distribution**: Vendor concentration in specific regions poses geopolitical and logistics risks.
- **Contract Expiry Trend**: A significant number of contracts expire within the next 12-18 months, indicating a crucial window for renegotiation or diversification.
