In light of business adjustments, we need to re-evaluate the true value of each job profile and the rationality of talent allocation. Please start with job profiles where job_value_tier is "Tier 1" or "Tier 2", and calculate the talent allocation saturation (current_employees_count/active_positions_count) and the talent quality index (high_performer_percentage * career_growth_potential_percentage) for each job profile. Then, for cases where talent_competition_level is "High" or "Very High", analyze which job profiles exhibit a mismatch between their actual output (measured by job_health_score and avg_career_development_score) and their market competition level. Further explore the differential patterns of these job profiles in terms of work characteristics such as avg_weekly_hours, is_work_shift_required, and retention_difficulty_level, and identify those job profiles with an imbalanced 'input-to-output ratio'. Finally, deliver a job value re-evaluation report that includes a specific list of job profiles recommended for optimization, suggestions for personnel redeployment, and a priority ranking for resource reallocation.
