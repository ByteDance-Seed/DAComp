**High-rated drivers (4.7+) earn 1% more per kilometer than low-rated drivers**, generating 34.3 currency units per kilometer compared to 34.0 for drivers with ratings below 4.3.

- **High Rating (4.7+)**: 34.3 currency units/km (14,076 rides)
- **Low Rating (<4.3)**: 34.0 currency units/km (43,823 rides)
- **Medium Rating (4.3-4.6)**: 33.5 currency units/km (35,101 rides)

**Why this matters**: While the direct earnings impact appears modest, high ratings correlate with ride allocation preferences on most platforms, potentially leading to more ride requests and higher utilization rates.

## Strategic Recommendations

### 1. Vehicle Type Selection
**Prioritize Go Sedan or Auto vehicles** for optimal earnings per kilometer. These vehicle types consistently outperform alternatives while maintaining strong ride volume (23,155 rides for Auto, 16,676 for Go Sedan).

### 2. Service Quality Maintenance
**Maintain driver ratings above 4.7** to access the highest earnings tier. Focus on:
- Professional communication with passengers
- Vehicle cleanliness and maintenance
- Safe, efficient route selection
- Courteous service delivery

### 3. Market Positioning
**Avoid eBike category** due to lowest earnings per kilometer (32.5 currency units). The 6.7% earnings premium for Go Sedan makes vehicle upgrade investments financially attractive.

### 4. Volume vs. Value Strategy
**Balance high-volume vehicle types (Auto) with high-value options (Go Sedan)**. Auto provides steady ride volume (23,155 completed rides), while Go Sedan offers premium per-kilometer earnings.

## Business Impact

Implementing these recommendations could increase annual earnings by 5-7% through strategic vehicle selection and service quality optimization. For a full-time driver completing approximately 2,500 rides annually, this represents a meaningful improvement in profitability without requiring additional driving hours.

The data demonstrates that **vehicle type selection has a stronger earnings impact than driver ratings**, making equipment choice the primary lever for earnings optimization in this market.
