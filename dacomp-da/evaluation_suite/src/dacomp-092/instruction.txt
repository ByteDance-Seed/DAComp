First, from the `profitability_analysis` table, identify the high-volatility customer segment ranking in the top 25% for `customer_margin_volatility`. Calculate the coefficient of variation (standard deviation / mean) of their `gross_profit` over the past 12 months and the variance of their quarter-over-quarter `invoice_total` growth rate to quantify their profit stability. Using behavioral features from the `customer_analytics` table such as `rfm_segment`, `payment_behavior`, and `revenue_trend_correlation`, explore the relationship between high volatility and customer lifecycle stages and payment patterns. By joining with `financial_dashboard` data, calculate the contribution of these customers to the overall `business_health_score` and the differential impact on `collection_rate_percentage`. Additionally, analyze the risk exposure distribution based on the accounts receivable structure from the `balance_sheet` table. Finally, build a multi-dimensional customer risk rating model that integrates volatility metrics, behavioral characteristics, and financial risks, and propose targeted customer management strategies.
