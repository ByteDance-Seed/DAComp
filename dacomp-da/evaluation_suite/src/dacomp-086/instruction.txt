We need to build a customer health score model to predict churn risk and formulate operational strategies. Please calculate a health score from 0-100 for each account based on dimensions such as last activity time, contact completeness, business value, industry type, and customer size. The weights are as follows: activity accounts for 40% (based on `days_since_last_activity` and `total_activities_30d`), contact quality for 30% (based on the `contacts_with_email`/`total_contacts` ratio), business value for 20% (based on `annual_revenue` and `total_won_amount`), and account scale for 10% (based on `account_size_segment` and `number_of_employees`). The output must include three core analyses: (1) Construct a customer risk warning matrix, cross-analyzing by industry and size, to identify high-risk customer segments with a health score below 50 and analyze their common characteristics; (2) Build a revenue contribution prediction model, based on the health score, historical won amount, and current pipeline value, to predict the potential revenue contribution of each customer over the next 6 months, and tier customers based on this contribution; (3) Design differentiated customer success strategies, proposing specific customer retention, expansion, and recovery action plans for different health score ranges (80+ High Health, 50-79 Medium, <50 Low Health) and different company sizes.
