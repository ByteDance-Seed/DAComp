### Standard 2.2 [Highest 6 points]: Conclusion summary
- Sub-standard 2.2.A.1 [1 point | Conclusion]: Watch Count and Showings have weak correlation (stating a correlation of 0.083 also earns points; allow 5% data error)
- Sub-standard 2.2.A.2 [1 point | Conclusion]: Floor affects Showings——especially mid-to-high floors have more Showings.
- Sub-standard 2.2.A.3 [1 point | Conclusion]: Area affects Showings——60–120 sqm is mainstream demand; very large or very small areas attract fewer showings.
- Sub-standard 2.2.A.4 [1 point | Conclusion]: Orientation affects Showings——South-facing listings have higher Showings.
- Sub-standard 2.2.A.5 [1 point | Conclusion]: Decoration affects Showings——Bare shell/Basic decoration are easier to show; Fully renovated and Luxury decoration are not advantageous.
- Sub-standard 2.2.A.6 [1 point | Conclusion]: Floor Plan affects Showings —— 3 bedrooms 2 living rooms is the most popular.
