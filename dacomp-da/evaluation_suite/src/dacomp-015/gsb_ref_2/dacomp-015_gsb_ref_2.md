## Which factors influence Showings
Observation: Average Showings vary meaningfully by Floor Plan, Decoration, Floor level, and Orientation.

- Floor Plan: Top 3 by Avg Showings 7BR 0LR (4.0 avg, 1 listings); 4 bedrooms, 0 living rooms (3.8 avg, 47 listings); 6-bedroom 0-living room unit (3.3 avg, 3 listings)
- Decoration: Top 3 by Avg Showings nan (8.3 avg, 3 listings); Simple renovation (2.9 avg, 9002 listings); Unfinished (2.8 avg, 2780 listings)

- Orientation: Top 3 by Avg Showings nan (8.3 avg, 3 listings); South (2.9 avg, 23342 listings); Southeast (2.6 avg, 924 listings)

Root cause: These patterns reflect segment preferences—certain layouts (Floor Plan) optimize usability, higher-quality Decoration signals move-in readiness, mid/high Floors may balance light/noise, and favorable Orientation improves natural light.
Business impact: Aligning inventory and promotion with high-showings categories can boost appointment conversion and shorten time-to-sale.

## Recommendations
- Double-down on the top Watch Count combinations with targeted promos (feature them on homepage, boost ads). Expect uplift where Total Watch Count is already high.
- Prioritize listings with high-Showings factors (top Floor Plan and Decoration types); highlight natural light (Orientation) and noise/light trade-offs (Floor) in copy.
- A/B test listing titles and hero photos emphasizing the high-performing trait mix; measure Showings and CTR changes weekly.
- For lower-performing combinations, adjust pricing anchors or improve Decoration to nudge Showings upwards.
- Enrich lead capture: since Watch Count correlates with Showings (r close to 0.083), funnel optimizations should increase booked appointments.
