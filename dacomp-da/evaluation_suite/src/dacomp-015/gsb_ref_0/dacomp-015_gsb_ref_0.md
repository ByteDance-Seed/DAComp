### Decoration Impact
**Simple renovation leads to 2.87 average showings** - the highest among all decoration types. This suggests buyers prefer properties that offer renovation flexibility rather than paying premium prices for completed work. High-quality renovation (2.80 showings) and unfinished properties (2.82 showings) perform nearly equally, indicating buyers are equally interested in move-in ready and customizable options.

### Floor Plan Impact
**4-bedroom, 0-living room units generate 3.83 showings** - the highest among floor plans. This unexpected finding suggests strong demand for maximum bedroom space, potentially from large families or investors seeking rental properties. Traditional 3-bedroom, 2-living room layouts follow closely with 3.09 showings.

### Orientation Impact
**South-facing units drive 2.94 showings** - significantly outperforming other orientations by 12-35%. This aligns with conventional real estate wisdom favoring southern exposure for optimal sunlight. Southeast (2.57) and East-facing (2.46) units follow, while North-facing units generate the fewest showings at 2.18.

### Floor Level Impact
Higher floors generally command more interest, with **39th-45th floors generating 4.5-5.6 showings**. This premium for elevated positions reflects buyer preferences for better views, reduced noise, and perceived prestige.

## Key Insights & Recommendations

1. **Premium Listings Strategy**: Focus marketing efforts on 4-bedroom, 2-living room units with high-quality renovation on higher floors (15th+) to maximize online engagement and watch counts.

2. **Showing Optimization**: Prioritize showing south-facing units and consider pricing adjustments for north-facing properties to account for lower demand.

4. **Floor Premium**: Capitalize on the premium associated with higher floors (30th+) by highlighting view advantages in marketing materials.

5. **Inventory Management**: Balance inventory between move-in ready (high-quality renovation) and customizable (simple/unfinished) properties to cater to different buyer segments.

The data reveals clear patterns in buyer preferences, with online engagement driven by premium features while physical showings are influenced by practical considerations like orientation and renovation flexibility.
