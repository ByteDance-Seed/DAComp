# [Total score | 20 points] The solution must meet two requirements:
- Requirement 1: Determine whether the survey data support the view that “the higher the parents' education level, the better the children's academic performance” (the relationship between parents' education level and children's academic performance must be quantified)
- Requirement 2: Filter and analyze from the survey data the factors that have a greater impact on students' academic performance (the impact magnitude and direction must be specified)

### Criterion 1.1: Choice of method to quantify the relationship and data computation (up to 3 points)
#### Path 1.1.A [3 points | One-way ANOVA]

#### Path 1.1.B [2 points | Group mean comparison]
- Sub-criterion 1.1.B.1 [1 point | Completeness]: Group reasonably by parents' education level (must be consistent with the grouping in Path 1.1.A) and compute the average academic performance for each group; no grouping errors.

  ① Bachelor group ≈ 70.69 points;
  ② High School group ≈ 69.26 points;

#### Path 1.1.D [3 points | ANOVA]
- Sub-criterion 1.1.D.1 [1 point | Completeness]: Use ANOVA to determine specific group differences; present the complete grouping for parents' education level (e.g., Master, Bachelor, High School—no omission/merging).
- Sub-criterion 1.1.D.2 [2 points | Accuracy]: Statistical computations are accurate and consistent with the reference data:
  ① F statistic ≈ 1.65;
  ② p-value ≈ 0.19.
### Criterion 1.2: Conclusion for validating the view (up to 1 point)
#### Path 1.2.A [1 point | Conclusion]
- Sub-criterion 1.2.A.1 [1 point | Conclusiveness]: Clearly state that the view “the higher the parents' education level, the better children's academic performance” is not supported

- Sub-criterion 2.1.A.7 [1 point | Completeness]: Analyze other influencing factors’ impact on academic performance, such as Diet quality, Age, Gender, Internet quality, Extracurricular activity participation, etc.; answering one will earn the point
- Sub-criterion 2.1.A.8 [3 points | Accuracy]: Accurately compute correlation coefficients; the following are reference data (you must correctly answer 3 or more of these to get the points; a 5% deviation is allowed)
  | Factor                    | Correlation coefficient |
  |--------------------------|------------------------:|
  | Daily study time         | 0.8254                  |
  | Social media usage time  | -0.2142                 |
  | Attendance rate          | 0.1375                  |
  | Sleep duration           | 0.1217                  |

- Sub-criterion 2.1.B.8 [2 points | Accuracy]: Verify in turn the average academic performance corresponding to different factors (the solution must provide 3 influencing factors, and the data must be correct to earn the points)
  ```Pseudo-code: verify the calculation process for a single case
  For each influencing factor’s different parameter values and their corresponding average academic performance
    1. Based on the factor values given in the solution, compute the corresponding average academic performance
    2. You must ultimately present each influencing factor’s values and their corresponding average academic performance
