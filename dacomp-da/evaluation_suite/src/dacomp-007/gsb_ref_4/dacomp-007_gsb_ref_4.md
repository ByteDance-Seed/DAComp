## Interpretation
- **Job Satisfaction**: R&D employees report slightly higher job satisfaction than Human Resources but slightly lower than Sales. This may contribute to the lower attrition rate in R&D.
- **Work-Life Balance**: Human Resources has the highest work-life balance score, yet it still has a higher attrition rate. This suggests that work-life balance alone is not the primary driver of attrition.
- **Salary Hike**: R&D receives the highest average salary hike, which likely contributes to its lower attrition rate.

## Recommendations
1. **Improve Job Satisfaction in High-Attrition Departments**: Sales and Human Resources should focus on initiatives that enhance job satisfaction, such as career development programs and recognition systems.
2. **Align Salary Hikes Across Departments**: Ensuring competitive salary increases in all departments can help reduce attrition.
3. **Investigate Additional Factors in R&D**: Further analysis should explore other potential factors in R&D, such as team dynamics, leadership quality, or role clarity, that may contribute to lower attrition.

## Conclusion
The lower attrition rate in R&D appears to be driven by a combination of higher job satisfaction and better salary increases. While work-life balance is slightly lower in R&D, it does not seem to significantly impact attrition. Strategic interventions in job satisfaction and compensation can help reduce attrition across all departments.
