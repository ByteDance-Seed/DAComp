## Executive Summary

The Research & Development department demonstrates a significantly lower overall attrition rate of **13.75%** compared to Human Resources (19.05%) and Sales (20.67%).

R&D offers a clear 6-role career progression path compared to only 2-3 roles in other departments:
- **Entry Level**: Research Scientist (293 employees, 16% attrition), Laboratory Technician (261 employees, 24% attrition)

### 2. Strong Compensation Progression
R&D demonstrates a clear financial incentive structure:
- **2.3x salary increase** from entry-level ($3,240) to mid-career roles ($7,300-7,500)
- **5x salary increase** from entry-level to senior roles ($16,000-17,100)
- Consistent 15% average salary hikes across all levels
