- Sub-criterion 2.1.B.4 [1 point | Conclusiveness]: Derive the insight: "High intrinsic work value and strong professional identity."
### Criterion 2.2: Conclusion 2 — Clear career path; specialized technical roles have clear advantages (up to 5 points)
#### Path 2.2.A [5 points | Career development and promotion path analysis]
- Sub-criterion 2.2.A.1 [1 point | Completeness]: Analyze promotion intervals (YearsSinceLastPromotion) across departments
- Sub-criterion 2.2.A.2 [1 point | Completeness]: Analyze TrainingTimesLastYear
- Sub-criterion 2.2.A.3 [2 points | Accuracy]: Provide accurate career development data (error ≤ 10%); reference ranges:
  - YearsSinceLastPromotion: R&D ≈ 2.127 ± 0.2 years, Sales ≈ 2.358 ± 0.2 years, HR ≈ 1.778 ± 0.3 years
  - TrainingTimesLastYear: R&D ≈ 2.792 ± 0.15 times, Sales ≈ 2.844 ± 0.15 times, HR ≈ 2.556 ± 0.15 times
- Sub-criterion 2.2.A.4 [1 point | Conclusiveness]: Based on data or comparative analysis, conclude the department’s structural advantages in career development, promotion mechanisms, or retention mechanisms.
#### Path 2.2.B [5 points | Job structure and professional attributes analysis]
- Sub-criterion 2.2.B.1 [1 point | Completeness]: Analyze each department’s JobLevel distribution and the proportion of specialized technical roles
- Sub-criterion 2.2.B.2 [1 point | Completeness]: Analyze differences in attrition costs between specialized technical roles and general roles
- Sub-criterion 2.2.B.3 [2 points | Accuracy]: Provide accurate job level structure data (error ≤ 3%); reference ranges:
  - Management tier proportion (JobLevel 3+): R&D ≈ 25.54%, Sales ≈ 29.33%, HR ≈ 26.98%
  - Level 1 junior proportion: R&D ≈ 44.98%, Sales ≈ 17.11%, HR ≈ 52.38%
- Sub-criterion 2.2.B.4 [1 point | Conclusiveness]: Derive the insight: "Specialized technical roles have a high cost of attrition."
### Criterion 2.3: Conclusion 3 — Lower attrition propensity under comparable profiles (deep mechanism analysis) (up to 4 points)
#### Path 2.3.A [4 points | Layered comparative analysis]
- Sub-criterion 2.3.A.1 [1 point | Completeness]: Stratify by JobLevel, SalarySlab, etc., and compare attrition rates across departments
- Sub-criterion 2.3.A.2 [2 points | Accuracy]: Provide accurate stratified attrition rate data (error ≤ 2%); reference ranges:
  - Level 1 attrition rate: R&D ≈ 23.22%, Sales ≈ 41.56%, HR ≈ 30.30%
  - Attrition rate for SalarySlab 'Upto 5k' (salary < 5k): R&D ≈ 19.82%, Sales ≈ 26.54%, HR ≈ 27.78%; if the assistant’s salary definition differs, judge by verifying the correctness of the code
