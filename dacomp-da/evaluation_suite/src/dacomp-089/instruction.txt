We need to establish a contact configuration risk monitoring system for our key accounts, specifically those in the top 20% by annual revenue. Please analyze these accounts based on the following metrics: Contact Density Ratio (Number of Contacts / Number of Employees * 1000, with a benchmark of ≥5), Decision-Maker Ratio (Proportion of C-level + VP-level contacts, with a benchmark of ≥15%), and Departmental Coverage Completeness (coverage across five key departments: Sales, Finance, Operations, IT, and HR). Based on industry characteristics and customer size, you are to develop differentiated assessment standards, identify high-risk accounts, and design a customer contact optimization action plan that includes prioritization and specific expansion recommendations.
