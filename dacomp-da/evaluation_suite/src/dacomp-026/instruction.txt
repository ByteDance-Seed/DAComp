For the Level 5 disasters in the `disaster_events` table, identify the relevant records and then systematically assess emergency response resource allocation effectiveness across the human resources (`human_resources` + `operations1`), financial resources (`financials1`), material supplies (`supplies1` + `distribution_hubs`), and transportation (`transportation1`) dimensions. Describe how the resource mix supports operational outcomes, highlight documented anchors (e.g., staffing ratios, ROI, delivery efficiency), and explain how your conclusions draw on the English schema terminology so that the assessment fully captures the quantified performance expectations for Level 5 events.
