From the `quickbooks__vendor_performance` table, identify 'high-quality, shrinking-spend' vendors where `annual_spend_growth_pct` is negative but the `overall_performance_score` is 7 or higher. For these vendors, calculate the spend volatility coefficient (`spend_volatility` / `total_lifetime_spend`) and a composite risk score (`payment_completion_rate` * 0.4 + `business_value_score`/10 * 0.6). Using the corresponding transaction records for each `vendor_id` from the `quickbooks__general_ledger` table, calculate the spend change rate for the last 12 months versus the prior 12 months for each vendor, categorized by `account_type`. Also, calculate the transaction frequency density (number of transactions / active days) for each account type. Based on the `quickbooks__cashflow_forecast` data, build a cash flow impact model assuming a 30% reduction in collaboration with these vendors, and calculate the adjusted monthly outflow forecast and the change in the liquidity risk index.
