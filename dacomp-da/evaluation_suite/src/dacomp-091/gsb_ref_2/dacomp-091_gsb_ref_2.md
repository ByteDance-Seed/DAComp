## Strategic Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (0-3 months)
1. **Vendor Segmentation**: Prioritize top 50 vendors by current spend for immediate review
2. **Contract Renegotiation**: Focus on vendors with high volatility coefficients (>1.5)

### Medium-term Strategy (3-12 months)
1. **Vendor Consolidation**: Reduce vendor count by 15% through strategic partnerships
2. **Performance Monitoring**: Implement monthly tracking of spend volatility and performance scores
3. **Alternative Sourcing**: Identify backup vendors for high-risk relationships

### Long-term Optimization (12+ months)
1. **Strategic Partnerships**: Convert top-performing vendors to preferred partner status
2. **Volume Commitments**: Negotiate better rates with consistent high-performers
3. **Technology Integration**: Implement automated vendor performance monitoring

## Risk Mitigation

### Liquidity Risk Management
- **Critical risk periods** identified in October-November 2025 and February 2027
- **Recommended action**: Build 15% cash reserves during low-risk periods
- **Vendor payment deferral**: Negotiate 30-day extensions during critical periods

### Vendor Relationship Risks
- **Performance degradation**: Monitor vendors with declining performance trends
- **Supply chain disruption**: Maintain 2-3 backup vendors per category
- **Concentration risk**: No single vendor should exceed 5% of total spend
