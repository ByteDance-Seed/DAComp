Based on `klaviyo__persons`, `klaviyo__person_campaign_flow`, and `marts.klaviyo__events`, segment users into lifecycle stages (Cold Start: first touch with no prior activity; Win-back: re-engaged after 90 days of inactivity). Use `days_span`, `active_months`, `paid_retained_month_count`, and `paid_retention_rate_month` to measure the speed from first touch to peak activity and its relationship with long-term retention/payment. Compare touchpoint efficiency by incorporating `email_open_rate`, `email_open_rate_touch`, `email_click_to_open_rate_touch`, and `has_converted`. Additionally, explore the impact of typical touchpoint paths on retention and payment based on `touch_type` sequences, and propose optimization recommendations for frequency, cooling periods, and content cadence.
