Using the metrics in `order_information`, analyze how the annual profit margin for each `Product Category` fluctuated from 2022 through 2024 by computing profit ÷ Sales at the category-by-year grain. Identify the category whose profit margin shows the largest swing, investigate the drivers of that volatility through the shipping, SKU, product, pricing, and engagement indicators available in `order_information` and `product_browsing`, and then build an RFM segmentation (Recency/Frequency/Monetary derived from `Order Date`, `Order ID`, and revenue or `profit`) to isolate the category’s core consumers and assess whether they are more sensitive to the identified fluctuation driver.
