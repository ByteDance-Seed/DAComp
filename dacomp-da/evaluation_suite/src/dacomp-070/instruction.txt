Analyze the decay patterns of user acquisition cost-efficiency for each region and device type combination over the past 6 months. Identify the non-linear relationship between `store_listing_conversion_rate` and `quality_score`/`crash_rate_per_1k`. By constructing a multi-dimensional user value decay model, predict optimization strategies for `revenue_per_active_device` under different market maturities. Additionally, quantify the interaction effect of app update frequency on `active_devices_last_30_days` and `rolling_total_average_rating`. Provide data-driven recommendations for formulating differentiated product iteration and market investment strategies.
